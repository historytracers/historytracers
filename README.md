## What is History Tracers?

## Why Another Educational Project?

Teaching is often a daily challenge for both students and teachers, each for different reasons. Our goal is to support both sides of the learning process by providing diverse tools.

### The Main Tool

Unsurprisingly, the main teaching tool in *History Tracers* is **YOU**. Through our own body, we study different sciences.

### Texts with Audio

With the exception of two sections that will soon receive audio (*General History* and *Historical Events*), all project texts already include narration. This way, in addition to reading and practicing, you can also listen to the content whenever you like.

### Images

Purely written texts may be challenging for some people. For this reason, we present illustrated content whenever necessary.

### Genealogy

Family relationships play an important role in education, as they make knowledge literally become part of our lives. For this reason, we use genealogy in different types of content.

### Practices

Theoretical teaching is important, but science without practice is not science. For this reason, most texts include, at the end, questions with answers so you can check whether you understood the content. In addition, some texts include practices that can be carried out at home.

### Multidisciplinarity

The word that names this section is long and equally deep. It highlights the need for content from different disciplines to be presented together. For this reason, the same text from *History Tracers* may appear in different sections.

### Videos

In some texts, we also present videos to further illustrate the content.

## Why Can't I Access the Site Locally?

Our project is designed to minimize page reloads and does not consolidate all its code into a single file. Consequently, attempting to open the `index.html` file locally triggers the need to load additional JavaScript files, resulting in your browser interpreting it as a [CORS request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=firefox-cors-errors&utm_campaign=default), and blocking access.

To enable local access to the content, we have developed a simple web server using [GO](https://go.dev/). After installing GO on your host machine, you can execute the following command:

```sh
$ go run src/history_tracers.go
Listening Port 12345 without devmode content /
```

Once you've completed these steps, you can open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:12345`.

## Adding a New Language

To incorporate a new language into the project, begin by creating a directory. Subsequently, execute a script that automatically generates all necessary files for the new language:

```sh
$ mkdir lang/es-ES
$ cd scripts
$ bash create_language.sh --path "es-ES" --msg "Aguardando traducci√≥n"
```

Lastly, you can incorporate content in another language. It's advisable to commence by handling files whose names do not follow the [Universal Unique Identifier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UUID) format.
