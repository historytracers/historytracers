This omission has historically made it challenging to translate and understand texts. In modern Arabic, however, short vowels and additional phonemes are often included, as seen in the form **مُحَمَّد** (Muhammad).\n\nRegardless of the writing system, both horizontal directions share a common feature: when reaching the end of a line, the text continues onto the next line, following a vertical direction from top to bottom.\n\nSome writing systems, such as Mongolian and Mesoamerican hieroglyphs, adopt a vertical direction from top to bottom. An example of this can be seen in the stele shown in Figure 2",

Thus, the direction and sense of a text extend beyond its physical arrangement.\n\nThe depth of the text is crucial for building narratives. Texts based on isolated fragments or taken out of context often lack important details, which can lead to misinterpretations. In contrast, texts that provide detailed documentation and are the result of years of research tend to be more complex and nuanced. The *Scientific Method* Game in *History Tracers* explores this difference, illustrating practical cases from different historical moments",
