Thus, the direction and sense of a text extend beyond its physical arrangement.\n\nThe depth of the text is crucial for building narratives. Texts based on isolated fragments or taken out of context often lack important details, which can lead to misinterpretations. In contrast, texts that provide detailed documentation and are the result of years of research tend to be more complex and nuanced. The *Scientific Method* Game in *History Tracers* explores this difference, illustrating practical cases from different historical moments",
