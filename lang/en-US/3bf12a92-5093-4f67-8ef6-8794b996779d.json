The main goal of this page is demonstrating that <b>we have the same origin</b>.</p><p>The name given to Charles Darwin's theory, evolution, creates confusion for some readers. They can think about improving in a direction of something higher, when we have description of changes, that are named mutations (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('6ebf58d7-2f1d-47b6-84ac-07d1430c2981'); return false;\">DNA and Mutations, Berkeley</a>), happening through generations. These mutations in DNA, when they are favorable, help the specie to adapt better to environment conditions (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('71093c75-b1eb-4289-9711-698b054af418'); return false;\">Evolution: Changing Species Over Time, National Geographic</a>), so there is a high probability to be selected during genetic transmission for the individuals that have it.</p><p>The 19th century was an epoch with advances in our understanding of ourselves. Firstly, Charles Darwin described the origin of species through observations (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('71093c75-b1eb-4289-9711-698b054af418'); return false;\">Evolution: Changing Species Over Time, National Geographic</a>). A few years later, Gregor Mendel proposed the existence of a model where traits are inherited according to a rule of dominant and recessive combination (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('e5c72d95-7c3b-46ea-b2d7-bfdaa33db2af'); return false;\">Miko, Ilona, 2008</a>).  The two theories are the basis for our understanding about how species, like us, appear on earth. But, we were still missing where inside the organisms these changes happened. The final piece of the puzzle was added by Friedrich Miescher that named it \"nuclein\", but it was renamed later for \"deoxyribonucleic acid\", the famous DNA (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('24e35656-4e60-46b9-a4c4-08db2623336e'); return false;\">Pray, Leslie A., 2008</a>). Therefore, it is necessary to say that when DNA was discovered, it was not discovered its functionality. The DNA definition and how its structure has relationship with hereditary information came only during 20th century (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('3ce506ac-8895-40dd-89f7-57f80517aba4'); return false;\">Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al., 2002</a>).</p><p>When we work with genealogy, the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome, the uniparental DNAs, allow us to do a genetic mapping of distant ancestors more efficient than autosomal DNA (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('48954556-6e7a-49e0-b844-04c365ad3436'); return false;\">Jinam, Timothy A., et al., 2012, pp. 3515</a>). The first, mitochondrial DNA, is used to study maternal lineage, because paternal mitochondrial is \"discarded\" during fecundation (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('b1e3a2c4-3172-4330-b285-2242be45a739'); return false;\">Groleau, Rick, 2002, PBS</a>). During the evolution process, different ways to discard parental mitochondrial DNA were made, in mammals, like us, they are modified and degraded after fecundation (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('74183b32-3a4a-4414-bbcd-5131154a4979'); return false;\">Sato, Miyuki, and Ken Sato, 2013</a>). Analogous, for patrilineal lineage it is studied Y chromosome (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('f5d103cb-702c-46bd-a3f2-e62f279ee0c1'); return false;\">Louw, Marti, 2000, PBS</a>).</p><p>It is not uncommon to see people tracing their lineage until reach an initial couple using only references, would this family tree to have mistakes? This is a complicated question, that we can not avoid. The direct answer for the question is no. Is this answer a contradiction for what genetic is showing? This confusion needs explanation. The biological sciences were not made to show mistakes in human science, instead, they are complementary sciences. When someone makes his family tree to reach a specific couple, he is using sources that conduct to this conclusion, sources written before we knew something about DNA, so the family tree is correct according to used sources.</p><p>To make a genealogical tree using genetic means that in some moment names will not be available, on the other hand, this removes the number of generation limitation. Considering this, how many additional generations would we have using genetic? To answer this question, it is necessary to use not only history and genetic, but also the math: <ul><li>The writing systems appeared around 5500 years ago (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('22c3824d-559b-4341-b999-cd0bb39c6246'); return false;\">\"History of writing systems\", Encyclopedia Britannica.</a>), so it is not expected to have generations reported centuries before this period of time. Obviously, it is necessary to understand that events can be created according to some necessities, for example, the Sumerian kings \"lived\" for a long time, with highlight for Alalgar, that reigned for 36000 years (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('01ee98b4-e72d-47dd-81ee-138b20ac631d'); return false;\">Fink, Sebastian and Sazonov, Vladimir, 2019</a>). According to the freedom that write system allows, we use as limit for the life, the maximum period of time allowed by telomere, this means around 100 years (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('66c80cb5-4531-44f7-bbd4-3dd0ac7110e9'); return false;\">Steenstrup, Troels, et al., 2017</a>).</li> <li>After defining a limit for life, it is necessary to define years people have a new generation. We are studying a long period of time, where cultures and behaviors are changed. To do an approximation to work, we opt to follow the research of Richard J. Wang with other researchers. This implies the average of years for men to 30,7 ± 4,8 years and for women 23,2 ± 3,0 years in the past 250,000 years (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('dd34414b-8f55-4e5e-877a-c0e111e871be'); return false;\">Wang, Richard J., et al., 2023</a>).</li> <li>As the reader probably observed, in Richard J. Wang with other researchers' work, there is an uncertainty in the measure shown by signal '±', this uncertainty is part of all measure that we make. Here it is planned to do a simplified demonstration, so it is considered that the average generation for men is  30 years and for women is 23 years.</li> <li>For the majority of the time our specie existed, it was not possible to have generations without a man and a woman, because there was no artificial fecundation, it is selected only man generation age to go ahead with math.</li> <li>After all simplifications, it is possible to arrive at the conclusion that since write system was made, we had around 183 generations (5500 years/ 30 years/generations).</li> <li>The research of distinct paleontologists and geneticists shows that our specie is 250,000 years old, so applying the previous logic, it is possible to estimate around 8333 generations (250000 years / 30 years/generations).</li><li>These data show us that the genetic allowed us to find around 8150 generations that were 'hidden' by missing write system.</li></ul></p><p>For more details about our prehistoric ancestors, it is suggested for the reader to study Charles Darwin's work (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('e1339d6e-ab15-42c8-a75b-7a42fa47fffd'); return false;\">Darwin, Charles, 19--, Vol. I</a> ; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('57763a8f-035c-490b-8612-8e4c7cd4c10a'); return false;\">Darwin, Charles, 19--, Vol. II</a>) and text available on Britannica encyclopedia website ( <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('3ce506ac-8895-40dd-89f7-57f80517aba4'); return false;\">Tuttle, Russel H., 2023</a>).</p>" ],

Now, when we talk about our specie, <i>Homo sapiens</i> it is a long history, and this conduct us to questions: who are we? Who are the <i>Homo sapiens</i>?
