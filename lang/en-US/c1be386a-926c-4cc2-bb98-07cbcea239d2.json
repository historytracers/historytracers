When Was the Text Written?\n\nIdentifying the epoch in which a text was written is essential for understanding its style and the meaning of the words it contains, helping to avoid some common mistakes explained in this section.\n\nWhen analyzing a text written thousands of years ago through the lens of contemporary word meanings, there is a significant risk of misinterpretation. This occurs because the meanings of words can change over time, a phenomenon known as **semantic change** (<htcite0>).\n\nAnother common error is **anachronism**, which happens when a concept is incorrectly attributed to a period earlier or later than it actually belongs. For example, claiming that ancient texts reference DNA as genetic material before its discovery in the <htdate0> would be an anachronistic interpretation (<htcite1>; <htcite2>).",

Dr. Irving Finkel, in discussing the evolution of writing systems in Mesopotamia, explains that the Sumerians initially used pictograms. Over time, they developed symbols to represent complete words. Later, in Babylon and Syria, texts began to be written using syllables (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nThe complexity of ancient cuneiform systems increases because a single symbol could represent multiple sounds, requiring phonetic complements to determine both pronunciation and meaning. Similarly, a single sound could be written in various ways. Furthermore, ancient cuneiform texts lacked spaces between words, as seen in *Figure 2*, until the Persians introduced this practice (<htcite2>).",
