On the other hand, when we only think about situations like this, in which we are the main focus, it can say a lot about us.\n\n#### The Relationship Between Division and Multiplication\n\nWhen we talk about multiplication, we are adding repeated quantities by grouping them. In contrast, when we talk about dividing (sharing), our intention is to separate what is united. In this way, multiplication and division are connected, since both actions — grouping or splitting — act upon the same quantity. When the final result is obtained through multiplication (grouping), we can discover the initial state by sharing (dividing). On the other hand, after distributing part of a whole, we can regroup it again through multiplication.\n\n#### Writing Multiplication\n\nWe can understand mathematics as a way of summarizing what we observe in nature.

This leads us to reflect on what we know about the beginning of the universe (<htcite0>).\n\nAs we have seen, at the beginning the universe probably contained only energy, according to the models we have today. In other words, everything was concentrated — which made that state simple for the universe, but at the same time, empty.\n\nIf in our lives we had absolutely everything, just as the universe once did, we might also end up having nothing around us.\n\nThe complexity of the universe — and of our own lives — begins to emerge at the moment energy transforms into matter. This process leads, among other consequences, to our very existence.",

Furthermore, we observed that moving away from a fully centralized state and transforming the whole into something different allows, among other things, the existence of everything we know — and even some things we do not yet know (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nIn the next text of the *First Steps* section (<htcite2>) we will continue studying how the universe and we ourselves share (or divide) something beyond us.",
