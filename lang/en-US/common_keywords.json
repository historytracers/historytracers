Imagine that we identify someone as a potential ancestor, but we lack documentation to prove this connection. In this case, we form two hypotheses:<br /><br />1 - The person is an ancestor.<br />2 - The person is not an ancestor.<br /><br />As we find documents that either confirm or refute these hypotheses, we move from speculation to forming a theory. The validation of this theory depends on the available evidence.<br /><br />Now, suppose we find a book written centuries after the events, which mentions a connection, and three contemporaneous chronicles that do not mention this person. The absence of mentions in the chronicles can be interpreted as indirect evidence against the hypothetical relationship.<br /><br />Applying the concept of limits: the maximum number of contrary evidences (three) outweighs the single favorable account, which was written centuries after the person's lifetime. In this context, we tend to accept the absence of proof as more convincing, favoring the three contrary pieces of evidence over the single, less reliable one.",
