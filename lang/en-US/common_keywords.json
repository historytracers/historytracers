Considering this, it is necessary to clarify to the reader that, as someone who has followed a religion, I understand how the way science is taught can lead to this conclusion. Here, we wish to show that the main goal of science is to explain <b>how</b> natural events happen through models and experimentation.<br />This text was not written to discredit any beliefs; it aims to provide more details about ancient texts. Therefore, before reading it, we invite you to reflect anew on the relationship between science and religion:<br />How would you feel if, instead of opposing your beliefs, science helped you understand them better?",

Imagine that we identify someone as a potential ancestor, but we lack documentation to prove this connection. In this case, we form two hypotheses:<br /><br />1 - The person is an ancestor.<br />2 - The person is not an ancestor.<br /><br />As we find documents that either confirm or refute these hypotheses, we move from speculation to forming a theory. The validation of this theory depends on the available evidence.<br /><br />Now, suppose we find a book written centuries after the events, which mentions a connection, and three contemporaneous chronicles that do not mention this person. The absence of mentions in the chronicles can be interpreted as indirect evidence against the hypothetical relationship.<br /><br />Applying the concept of limits: the maximum number of contrary evidences (three) outweighs the single favorable account, which was written centuries after the person's lifetime. In this context, we tend to accept the absence of proof as more convincing, favoring the three contrary pieces of evidence over the single, less reliable one."
