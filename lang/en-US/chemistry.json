When studying the birth of galaxies, for example, we can identify chemical elements that are essential for life (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a11c68d9-d0c3-4fcc-b190-6316f9dfb144'); return false;\">Gibson, Carl H., et al., <htdate0>, pp. 10</a>).</p><p>Like any science, Chemistry is also directly connected to the language of mathematics. For this reason, we begin this section with Chapter 6 of the <i>First Steps</i>, which is dedicated to the study of mathematics in connection with other sciences. Thus, we recommend reading the first five chapters of that part before continuing (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('b5efc8f9-c268-430f-9681-7a43848ee48e'); return false;\"><i>History Tracers Team, First Steps</i></a>).</p><p>Although in school we are introduced to subjects called Science or Chemistry before entering university, teaching often limits itself to presenting only the initial stages of this field. These stages could be referred to as proto-Chemistry or pre-Chemistry, as proposed by Dr. Francisco González A. Redondo (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('cd61bc64-1358-4bfd-b343-3629facaa3b4'); return false;\"><i>González Redondo, Francisco A., <htdate1></i></a>; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('abc894b4-61b2-4f0f-a145-9d591cda41d2'); return false;\"><i>González Redondo, Francisco A., <htdate2></i></a>; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('81e9393b-d5b6-4b04-91bd-417e943d3e97'); return false;\"><i>History Tracers Team, The knowledge</i></a>).</p></p>In the texts of this section, we present the concepts of pre-Chemistry and proto-Chemistry, gradually connecting them to Chemistry through mathematics.</p>",
