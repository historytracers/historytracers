We understand that many people do not have enough time to study all these sciences in depth. To assist, we have prepared the following texts, which will serve as foundational resources in genealogy:</p><p><ul><li><htcite0>: A general overview of the origin of our species based on scientific research and various beliefs.</li><li><htcite1>: An explanation of the scientific method, including an example that can be performed at home.</li><li><htcite2>: A section designed to teach techniques for understanding texts and exploring their relationship with mathematics.</li><li><htcite3>: we guide the reader on how to obtain necessary documentation and start building their family tree.</li><li><htcite4>: we explain the various sources used in a research.</li><li><htcite5>: Introduces the reader to the concept of limits using examples from the human body and liquids.</li><li><htcite6>: Presents the reader with the various archaeological periods currently in use.</li><li><htcite7>: Studying families only when documents are available reduces the possibility of understanding who we are, besides bringing countless confusions, such as interpreting poetic texts as natural descriptions.<br />Therefore, it is essential to study the texts of the first chapter of the <b>Genealogical Trees</b> section before proceeding to the other chapters.</li></ul></p><p>Some families may require additional information, which will be listed below when necessary:</p>",

To address this misconception, the page distinguishes between primary sources that unequivocally validate an individual's existence and other references found in publications such as noble genealogies.
