One of these was presented by Dr. Francisco A. González Redondo in one of his lectures, where he demonstrates that women played an important role in the beginnings of mathematics (<htcite1>).\n\nThis process of recognizing equal capabilities is still limited, which is why figures like Wu Zetian (武則天) marked an era (<htcite2>).",

During research, it was not possible to determine whether the positions he held throughout his life were two distinct functions or if the studied sources present discrepancies.\n\nThe discrepancies related to his biography were possibly deepened by Li Jiao (李娇), who, when writing *Panlongtai bei* (攀龍臺碑), may have fabricated elements of the family history (<htcite2>).\n\nHowever, his life is not solely summarized by historiographical discrepancies. One of his acts, as a father, changed the course of history. Unlike many fathers of his time, Wu Shihuo (武士穫) encouraged his daughter to learn to read and write, as well as to develop intellectual skills traditionally reserved for men. Furthermore, he encouraged her to learn music and public speaking (<htcite3>).",
