One of these was presented by Dr. Francisco A. González Redondo in one of his lectures, where he demonstrates that women played an important role in the beginnings of mathematics (<htcite1>).\n\nThis process of recognizing equal capabilities is still limited, which is why figures like Wu Zetian (武則天) marked an era (<htcite2>).",

During research, it was not possible to determine whether the positions he held throughout his life were two distinct functions or if the studied sources present discrepancies.\n\nThe discrepancies related to his biography were possibly deepened by Li Jiao (李娇), who, when writing *Panlongtai bei* (攀龍臺碑), may have fabricated elements of the family history (<htcite2>).\n\nHowever, his life is not solely summarized by historiographical discrepancies. One of his acts, as a father, changed the course of history. Unlike many fathers of his time, Wu Shihuo (武士穫) encouraged his daughter to learn to read and write, as well as to develop intellectual skills traditionally reserved for men. Furthermore, he encouraged her to learn music and public speaking (<htcite3>).",

A good example of this cause-and-effect relationship can be observed in the trajectory of Wu Zetian (武則天).\n\nAt the age of 14, Wu Zetian (武則天) traveled with her parents to Chang’an to join the harem of Emperor Li Shimin (李世民), Taizong, as one of his concubines (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nBefore proceeding with her story, it is necessary to clarify some points of confusion: belonging to a Chinese harem did not necessarily mean submitting to a condition of inferiority before the emperor. Some women had responsibilities in the realm, such as reading poems and performing music, as happened with Zuo Fen (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nIt is also important to emphasize that concubines were part of an institutional system: polygamy. In this system, they could never assume the same prestige as the principal wife, such as spending the night with the emperor (<htcite4>).\n\nIn general, we can define the functions of an empress and concubines along three axes (<htcite5>):\n1. ensuring succession;\n2. acting as advisors;\n3. controlling the emperor's behavior.\n\n#### Rising\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Li Shimin (李世民), concubines who had not borne him children, including Wu Zetian (武則天), were sent to Ganye Temple to live as nuns, according to the traditions of the time. However, the new emperor, Li Zhi (李治), brought her back, despite already being married and having his own principal concubine (<htcite6>; <htcite7>).",

Wu Zetian (武則天) accused Wang, the principal wife, of killing her. Furthermore, Wu Zetian (武則天) supposedly implicated both the wife and the principal consort in accusations of magical practices, which culminated in the expulsion of all three from the palace (<htcite0>).\n\nThis sequence of events catapulted Wu Zetian (武則天) to the position of principal wife.\n\n#### The Ascent to Power\n\nWu Zetian (武則天) unofficially assumed control of the realm in the year <htdate1>. However, her actions demonstrate that she was not in an inferior position. She took women to regions where only men performed ceremonies, such as Mount Tai, and was also the real force behind the consolidation of dominion over Korea. To leave no doubt about her position, when Li Zhi (李治) proclaimed himself *\"Emperor of Heaven,\"* she proclaimed herself *\"Empress of Heaven\"* (<htcite1>).\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Li Zhi (李治), Wu Zetian (武則天) placed her son Li Xian (李顯) on the throne. However, after he and his wife acted against her interests, Wu Zetian removed him from power, enthroning another son, Li Dan (李旦), who also ended up opposing her interests (<htcite2>).\n\nThe impossibility of controlling her heirs led Wu Zetian (武則天) to proclaim herself empress of China (Zhongguo 中國) in the year <htdate2> (<htcite3>).\n\n#### Her Reign\n\nTo demonstrate that a new period was beginning, one of her first initiatives was to change the name of the Tang Dynasty (唐代) to Zhou, in addition to imprisoning members of the Tang royal lineage. Moreover, she proclaimed herself a reincarnation of the Buddha Maitreya, using Buddhism and other religions to her advantage (<htcite4>; <htcite5>; <htcite6>).",
