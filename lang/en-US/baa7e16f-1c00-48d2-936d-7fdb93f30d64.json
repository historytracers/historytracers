According to the narrative, torrential rains lasted seven days and nights. *Ziusudra*, however, managed to save himself, others, and various animals by building a giant boat.\n\nAt the conclusion of the flood, the sun god Utu descended from the heavens, entered the boat, and received sacrifices.

Despite their differences, they share common elements, such as a family surviving a massive flood by divine warning and constructing a large boat. We also examined how to assess the scale of these events by comparing them to historical records from nearby and distant civilizations. Additionally, we observed that stories of floods near rivers were common in antiquity.\n\nAlthough none of the events described here occurred literally, significant floods have shaped the history of our planet. In the next text, we will discuss these major floods, concluding this introductory chapter on interpreting historical texts",
