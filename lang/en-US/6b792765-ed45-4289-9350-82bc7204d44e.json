Additionally, the implementation of a legal system that came into effect in the year <htdate0> and remained until <htdate1> (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\n#### Climate Problem\n\nThe Tang Dynasty (唐代) period is also known for being marked by intense climatic events, such as strong winter monsoons, which, among their consequences, may have contributed to the end of the Tang Dynasty (唐代) (<htcite2>).",

Faced with this scenario, the Tang Dynasty (唐代) apparently chose a path that sought pacification, encouraging the population to venerate their local gods. This intensified devotion to local deities, leading to the performance of various rituals and sacrifices that, as poems from the time demonstrate, *\"saved them from drought by sending rains\"* (<htcite1>).\n\nIt should be emphasized that, in addition to religious rituals, during this same period, thanks to this devotion to local gods (<htcite2>):",

The rise of this dynasty, which lasted nearly 300 years (<htdate2>-<htdate3>), ushered in a new golden age in China (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nAlthough we are speaking of a Chinese dynasty, there is genetic evidence that helps in understanding the origin of the Tang (唐) which needs to be clarified. Studies of individuals from the Tang Dynasty (唐代) buried in the Fudamen (傅大门) cemetery in Shandong province indicate that they belonged to the Hu people (胡人)ethnic minorities living in northwest China, Central Asia, and western Eurasia. This suggests there was a process of sinicization of the Hu people (胡人)—a process by which non-Han cultures absorb elements of Han culture—through intermarriage (<htcite4>).\n\nThese intermarriages were, in a way, expected, as during the Sui (隋) and Tang (唐) dynasties, there was significant development of the Silk Road. Consequently, there was a continuous process of population mixing, with the ancestors of the Tang Dynasty (唐代) possibly being descendants of Sogdians from the Bukhara (安国) region in present-day Uzbekistan (<htcite5>).",

It began in the Taiyuan (太原) region, a frontier stronghold whose function was defense against attacks by the Turks. Precisely the contact with these foreign peoples allowed the Tang Dynasty to emerge within a political sphere centered on a Turkic confederation (<htcite1>).\n\nDuring his reign, Li Yuan had to face various rivals and rebels, consolidating complete control of the northern and southern regions of China around <htdate0> (<htcite2>).\n\nLi Yuan (李淵) adopted the land distribution and taxation system of the Sui Dynasty (隋). Among his most notable achievements was the introduction of copper coins (**Figure 3**), which continued to be used in later dynasties (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).",

After foiling a coup attempt by his brother, he himself ended up taking over his father's rule (<htcite0>).\n\nThe success of Li Shimin's (李世民) rise to power can be credited to his qualities as a military leader. As highlighted by W. P. Wong, Li Shimin (李世民) maintained a good personal relationship with his military personnel, regardless of whether they were of Chinese origin or not (<htcite1>). Also notable regarding his good relationships is his connection with Turkish nobles. According to Chen Yinke (陳寅恪), thanks to a blood oath with a Turkish noble, Li Shimin (李世民) was accepted by the Turks as one of their own (<htcite2>).\n\nLi Shimin (李世民) died of dysentery in the year <htdate0>. His legacy can be observed in the fact that various subsequent emperors followed his examples (<htcite3>).\n\nKnown as Taizong during his reign, Li Shimin (李世民) received other titles after his death, with the last one adopted being *\"The Great Civil and Martial, Vast and Bright, Filially Extensive Emperor\"* (Wenwu Dasheng Daguangxiao Huangdi 文武大聖大廣孝皇帝) (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).",
