Faced with this scenario, the Tang Dynasty (唐代) apparently chose a path that sought pacification, encouraging the population to venerate their local gods. This intensified devotion to local deities, leading to the performance of various rituals and sacrifices that, as poems from the time demonstrate, *\"saved them from drought by sending rains\"* (<htcite1>).\n\nIt should be emphasized that, in addition to religious rituals, during this same period, thanks to this devotion to local gods (<htcite2>):",

The way these posthumous names are applied is not uniform over time, but in the Tang dynasty (唐代), as there were many emperors from the same dynasty, the convention of using generic terms like “zong” was adopted (<htcite0>).\n\nIn this text, we follow the tradition of the Qin dynasty (秦代) of using the person's name out of respect for ancestors (<htcite1>).

The rise of this dynasty, which lasted nearly 300 years (<htdate2>-<htdate3>), ushered in a new golden age in China (Zhongguo 中國) (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nAlthough we are speaking of a Chinese dynasty, there is genetic evidence that helps in understanding the origin of the Tang (唐) which needs to be clarified. Studies of individuals from the Tang Dynasty (唐代) buried in the Fudamen (傅大门) cemetery in Shandong province indicate that they belonged to the Hu people (胡人) ethnic minorities living in northwest China (Zhongguo 中國), Central Asia, and western Eurasia. This suggests there was a process of sinicization of the Hu people (胡人)—a process by which non-Han cultures absorb elements of Han culture—through intermarriage (<htcite4>).\n\nThese intermarriages were, in a way, expected, as during the Sui (隋) and Tang (唐) dynasties, there was significant development of the Silk Road. Consequently, there was a continuous process of population mixing, with the ancestors of the Tang Dynasty (唐代) possibly being descendants of Sogdians from the Bukhara (安国) region in present-day Uzbekistan (<htcite5>).",

It began in the Taiyuan (太原) region, a frontier stronghold whose function was defense against attacks by the Turks. Precisely the contact with these foreign peoples allowed the Tang Dynasty to emerge within a political sphere centered on a Turkic confederation (<htcite1>).\n\nDuring his reign, Li Yuan had to face various rivals and rebels, consolidating complete control of the northern and southern regions of China (Zhongguo 中國) around <htdate0> (<htcite2>).\n\nLi Yuan (李淵) adopted the land distribution and taxation system of the Sui Dynasty (隋代). Among his most notable achievements was the introduction of copper coins (**Figure 3**), which continued to be used in later dynasties (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).",

After foiling a coup attempt by his brother, he himself ended up taking over his father's rule (<htcite0>).\n\nThe success of Li Shimin's (李世民) rise to power can be credited to his qualities as a military leader. As highlighted by W. P. Wong, Li Shimin (李世民) maintained a good personal relationship with his military personnel, regardless of whether they were of Chinese origin or not (<htcite1>). Also notable regarding his good relationships is his connection with Turkish nobles. According to Chen Yinke (陳寅恪), thanks to a blood oath with a Turkish noble, Li Shimin (李世民) was accepted by the Turks as one of their own (<htcite2>).\n\nLi Shimin (李世民) died of dysentery in the year <htdate0>. His legacy can be observed in the fact that various subsequent emperors followed his examples (<htcite3>).\n\nKnown as Taizong (太宗), Li Shimin (李世民) received other titles after his death, with the last one adopted being *\"The Great Civil and Martial, Vast and Bright, Filially Extensive Emperor\"* (Wenwu Dasheng Daguangxiao Huangdi 文武大聖大廣孝皇帝) (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).",

The first lasted less than a month, between <htdate0> and <htdate1>, being deposed by his mother upon realizing that his wife, Empress Wei (韋), exercised strong influence, contrary to her plans. This led to Li Xian (李顯) being removed from the throne and exiled by his own mother, Wu Zetian (武則天) (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>).\n\nUpon returning from exile, he reassumed the throne for a second reign, between <htdate2> and <htdate3>. Shortly after his return, he transferred the capital from Luoyang to Chang'an (<htcite3>).\n\nHis government was not long — and, according to some accounts, not fully effective either. During this short period, power was largely exercised by Empress Wei (韋), who would also have been responsible for his death, by poisoning him. Subsequently, she placed her son, Li Chongmao (李重茂), on the throne, acting as regent (<htcite4>; <htcite5>; <htcite6>).",

Governance only stabilized after the authorization for his aunt Taiping (太平) to take her own life (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nHis years of rule were marked by relative stability and a balance of power that included, even, Buddhist and Daoist religious leaderships (<htcite2>; <htcite3>; <htcite4>). As a consequence of this stability, the period of Li Longji's (李隆基) rule was characterized by social and cultural progress, in addition to an economic boom that led the interval from <htdate2> to <htdate3> to be known as the Kaiyuan Era (<htcite5>; <htcite6>; <htcite7>).\n\nOne of the possible consequences observed due to the advancements of his reign was the direct association of the emperor with figures from popular beliefs, such as Zhong Kui (鍾馗) (**Figure 4**), responsible for capturing and eliminating wandering demons and subsequently consolidated as a figure linked to exorcism practices (<htcite8>).",

In addition to these changes, a new tax system was successfully implemented, making the state rich and prosperous, to the point of lasting for a few centuries, until the Ming dynasty (明代) (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).",

Among the rulers of the last century of the Tang Dynasty (唐代), he is one of the few who accomplished notable feats (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>).\n\nHe revoked his grandfather's measure of placing eunuchs in military command, taking command himself. At the head of his army, he re-established stability in the nation (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).\n\nDespite his success, Li Chun (李純) also faced revolts between <htdate0> and <htdate1> (<htcite5>; <htcite6>).\n\nHis relationship with Chinese culture can be observed when, after years of chaos, he turned his attention to the imperial calligraphy collection, which, despite efforts, never returned to its former glory (<htcite7>).",

Soon after, in <htdate0>, a wave of peasant uprisings occurred (<htcite1>; <htcite2>). However, the worst was yet to come.\n\nHuang Chao (黃巢) organized a monumental rebellion that lasted approximately a decade (<htdate1> to <htdate2>) and took control of different regions of the country. He conquered important cities, including the capture of the capital Chang'an, proclaiming himself emperor (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).\n\nDuring the conquests and in his own government, Huang Chao's (黃巢) cruelty was a hallmark. According to Arab accounts from the year <htdate3>: “The inhabitants opposed him, and he left them besieged for a long period, until he defeated them. Then, he put the inhabitants to the sword. And it is mentioned that more than 120,000 Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Magians died…” (<htcite5>; <htcite6>).\n\nThis scenario of cruelty contributed to Huang Chao being removed from the capital Chang'an in <htdate4> with the help of an army still loyal and provincial generals, and he died in <htdate5>. With the help of the Shatuo Turks, the rebellion was finally defeated (<htcite7>).",

The strongest rebellion of the Tang government did not arise from nowhere; it had roots in bad governments that taxed the people without solving their problems (<htcite0>). On the other hand, the rebel government also did not solve the difficulties, additionally creating great repression and maintaining the unfavorable scenario for the population.<br /><br />Have you ever read or heard about governments that increase taxes while the people suffer from hunger?<br /><br />Have you heard of “saviors” who overthrow these governments by force and then oppress the people?<br /><br />And what about foreign intervention to assist one of the sides? Is that something new to you?<br /><br />And about religion being used to appease, while religious people of different beliefs are persecuted (<htcite1>; <htcite2>; <htcite3>)? Is that something new to you?<br /><br />And regarding climate changes, whether due to natural or human effects? Have you heard about that?<br /><br />If none of this is new, and the information you have heard is from the present day, have you ever noticed that perhaps what you are experiencing recently already happened over a thousand years ago — and that you might be seeing the same mistakes repeated?</div></div></center>",

The rebel Zhu Wen (朱溫), who had followed Huang Chao (黃巢), surrendered with his troops and was rewarded with control of the Kaifeng region in central China (Zhongguo 中國). Shortly after the fall of Huang Chao (黃巢), a conflict occurred between Zhu Wen (朱溫) and the Turkish general Li Keyong, who had helped defeat the rebellion. Thanks to his victory, Zhu Wen forced Emperor Zhaozong (昭宗) to move the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang  (<htcite1>).\n\nLi Ye (李曄) and most of his children were killed by Zhu Wen (朱溫) in the year <htdate0> (<htcite2>).",
