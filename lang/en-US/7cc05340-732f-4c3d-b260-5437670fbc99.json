We also saw that matter can exist in different states, but that this alone would not be enough to contract everything in the universe. Finally, we understood that there is a quantity called energy, into which mass can be converted.\n\n#### Our Logic\n\nThe timeline of the universe we built has also been confirmed by various experiments, such as those that discovered and deepened knowledge about the first radiations (energy) detected in the universe (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that, in the beginning, there was something unique that we now measure and call energy. The fact that energy can be converted into matter (<htcite4>) allows us to create models to explain what we observe. Once again, we emphasize: no model or proposal should be considered a final answer that becomes a barrier to knowledge. We must always question and test in the search for new understanding.\n\n#### And Mathematics in the Universe?\n\nConsidering everything we have seen so far, we might think that when energy transforms into matter, something visible is added to the universe. Since this happens many times, we can also say that nature “multiplied” matter. This is one way of interpreting how the universe has evolved over the last billions of years, but it is not the only one.",

This indicates that everything in the universe shares a common origin.",
