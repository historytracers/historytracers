Instead, patronymics were employed, that is, names formed from the father's first name (<htcite1>).\n\nDespite the fact that, today, we see different people using Dias as a surname, it is not possible to claim that they all belong to the same family, as we will see below.\n\n#### The Patronymic\n\nThe origin of the surname Dias as a patronymic becomes evident when analyzing medieval documents. The \"Corónica Navarra\", for example, mentions Rodrigo Díaz, El Cid, as the son of Diego Laínez, grandson of Laín Núñez, and great-grandson of Nuño Laínez (<htcite2>; <htcite3>):",

In this period, it is possible to verify their use by over 90% of the Portuguese population (<htcite2>).\n\nA significant transition is also observed in this context: patronymics like Dias, which initially indicated lineage, gradually began to be used as hereditary surnames (<htcite3>).\n\n#### Consequences\n\nThe conversion of patronymics into surnames ended up creating a false idea of kinship between people who shared the same last name, leading many to believe they belonged to the same family. To give an idea, in old São Paulo de Piratininga, Américo de Moura identified ten distinct family groups using the surname Dias, with no relation to each other (<htcite4>).",

Thus, it would be more likely to associate Isabel Dias with someone more aligned with the colonizers.\n- João Mendes de Almeida, in a genealogical, linguistic, and geographical analysis, considers it illogical to regard Tibiriçá as the \"headman\". On the contrary, he mentions Piqueróbi as the great Tupi chief (<htcite1>).\n\nWe must emphasize that the conclusions of João M. de Almeida about one leader do not reflect a consensus. What is still accepted today is that, upon the arrival of the colonizers, the land was divided among three brothers: Piqueroby, Tibiriçá, and Caiubi. The indigenous people under Piqueroby's rule did not accept colonization, which resulted in a war in the year <htdate0> (<htcite2>).\n\nFinally, given the lack of documents or chronicles that confirm any connection of Isabel Dias with a specific leader, we will consider Isabel Dias's father as unknown.",

However, this hypothesis has several inconsistencies:\n- As stated in the introduction, there was not only one Dias family;\n- Contemporary documents link him directly to the Carmelite Order and to the Church of São Paulo, showing his strong connection to the Christian faith;\n\n- The name “Lopo” (or “Lubb”) was not exclusive to any one faith — Islamic families such as the Banu Qasi also used it — showing that the use of the name was not restricted to a single religious group (<htcite5>).\n\nTherefore, his religious identity cannot be defined based solely on his name.\n\nHis descendants will be presented together with those of his wife, in respect for indigenous traditions (<htcite6>).",

Castro Coelho provides data about a play in which a \"Pedro Dias\" was the main character, played by the same Pedro Dias mentioned in the initial proposal (<htcite0>).\n\nAnother important piece of information, found in a footnote, states that no dispensation for a Pedro Dias was found in the Society of Jesus documents (<htcite1>).\n\n#### Conclusions\n\nRegarding the report of the marriage to a supposed daughter of Tibiriçá, it is possible to state that there is no proof. Late genealogies cannot be considered evidence for these events.\n\nSimilarly, it is not possible to infer whether they are exactly the same people, as there are no documents in São Paulo from the period when there is a record of a Brother Pedro Dias in Bahia.\n\nThus, we can—cautiously—separate the facts documented in the minutes from the doubts that remain in both lines of research, as well as recognize that it is impossible to state who his first wife was.\n\nThis text will not detail the generations of Pedro Dias and his wives. We recommend searching for documents that can validate the works mentioned here.",

Beyond the figure of the emperor, the large landowners, and the enslaved people, there was also a generic group called “agregados“.\n\nThe definition of “agregado” is quite broad, with different meanings over time (<htcite0>). In the context of this text, we are possibly dealing with a free person who resided on lands granted by the owner, in exchange for work (<htcite1>). However, the hypothesis that they could also be descendants of someone who had been enslaved is not ruled out.\n\n#### A Possible Dependent Family\n\nThe Population Map of Cachoeira do Campo from the year <htdate0>, in *Fogo 10*, lists among the dependent families a white woman, D. Luiza, living alongside free \"pardos\" (mixed-race) and \"crioulos\" (Brazilian-born individuals of African descent). Among these people is Bento Dias, our character. They all resided on the property of Anna Theodora Pimenta (<htcite2>).\n\nWhen observing the free \"pardo\" people, it is noticeable that most signed with the surname Dias, with an age difference of about 11 years between the oldest and the youngest. This fact leads us to suppose that we are, possibly, looking at the same family (<htcite3>).",

In this document, we are informed that one of the people responsible for her assets was Maria Ursulla, who lived in *Fogo 10* (household) of the <htdate1> Population Map (<htcite1>).\n\nThe fact that Maria Ursulla became responsible for the assets had direct consequences for Bento's life. In the <htdate2>, population map, it is observed that he was living in Dona Maria Ursulla's house, already married to Anastacia, who had been freed since the last record. Both worked in the residence as a tailor and seamstress, respectively (<htcite2>).\n\n#### News\n\nBy <htdate3>, it is clear that the life of Bento Dias and his family continued to progress. In a new population map, he no longer lived as a dependent in Dona Maria Ursulla's house—he now had his own *Fogo*, number 83.\n\nOther changes are also observed (<htcite3>):\n- Bento Dias begins to adopt the surname Silva, common to the two women who had taken him in;\n- He is identified as a tailor;\n- His wife appears for the first time with devotional surnames: Maria de Jesus;\n- The family grows: the couple has four children.\n\nBento Dias (da Silva) is mentioned again in an <htdate4>, document, when he appears to receive a \"terça\" (a third, likely a portion of an inheritance) donated to his wife as an inheritance (<htcite4>).",
