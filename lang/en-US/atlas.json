Look at Figure 1, which consists of 8 subimages. Imagine cutting these subimages apart and turning them into a jigsaw puzzle with 8 pieces. Each piece represents a fraction of the main image, and if we give one piece to each of 8 people, each person holds 1/8 of the whole. When all the pieces are brought together, we reconstruct the original image. This exercise illustrates how individual parts, when reunited, recreate the original whole.</p><h4>Understanding the Angle θ</h4>In Figure 1, subimage \"(g)\" looks similar to subimage \"(c)\" but has a key difference: it displays angle values from two perspectives. The inner values represent angle projections on a circle, as if viewed from above. In contrast, the outer values represent coordinates on a Cartesian plane, shown around the circle.</p>",

On the summer solstice, he observed that in the city of Syene, the Sun’s rays reached straight to the bottom of a well, while in Alexandria, a pole cast a shadow pointing south.

For his measurements, Al-Biruni was in Kath during a lunar eclipse, recording the event’s timing, while his colleague Abu’l-Wafa made observations in Baghdad. Additionally, Al-Biruni used the distances of caravan routes to determine the difference in longitude between Baghdad and Ghazni.

This fact raises the possibility that the Greeks either acquired this knowledge from other civilizations or independently arrived at the same conclusions more than a thousand years later (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('5488872a-27c1-4ea8-8580-2ecc5aeb0cbf'); return false;\">Mansfield, D.

Dr. Irving Finkel, in explaining the map featured in this section, also references a cuneiform text preserved in the British Museum. This text makes mention, among other things, of an Ark and its dimensions. Finkel points out a shared element between the map and this text: the word <i>parsiktu</i>, which denotes a unit of volume (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('81161bc9-dd2a-4a11-906d-10427a5946d6'); return false;\">Finkel, I, <i>The British Museum</i></a> ; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('8637140f-b357-45d4-8c59-e39a289096ab'); return false;\">Finkel, I, <i>The Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures</i>, 50:06 - 56:11</a>).<br /><br />Additionally, Dr. Finkel notes that one of the mountains mentioned on the map is near a region called Urartu—located in present-day Armenia, Türkiye, and Iran—which corresponds to \"Ararat\" mentioned in the book of Genesis in the Hebrew text. Given the way the Pentateuch was composed, it is possible that Babylonian traditions influenced later Jewish narratives, as Dr. Finkel suggests (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('81161bc9-dd2a-4a11-906d-10427a5946d6'); return false;\">Finkel, I, <i>The British Museum</i></a> ;  <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('8637140f-b357-45d4-8c59-e39a289096ab'); return false;\">Finkel, I, <i>The Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures</i>, 50:06 - 56:11</a> ; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillHolySource('56e19b6d-5b12-4a9d-abff-7c85ff465872'); return false;\">Torah, Neviim u-Khetuvim.
