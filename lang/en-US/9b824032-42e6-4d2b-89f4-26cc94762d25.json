Initially, we learned to assign characteristics to the scale and compare objects based on these characteristics. The final relationship between objects and characteristics was determined by assigning 10 points for each identified characteristic. Thus, the more characteristics an object possessed, the closer it was to the maximum value; conversely, with fewer characteristics, it stayed nearer to the minimum value.\n\nSubsequently, we examined how Alan R. Templeton demonstrated the absence of races within humankind. He began by analyzing genetic samples from various individuals, including both chimpanzees and humans. In the case of chimpanzees, it was found that genetic differences between individuals could exceed 25%, indicating the existence of distinct races. However, when the same analysis was applied to humans, it revealed that genetic differences were less than 5%. This indicates that humans share at least 95% of their genetic characteristics, which invalidates the concept of races within our species.",
