For this reason, we begin this section with Chapter 6 of the <i>First Steps</i> part, which is dedicated to the study of mathematics in connection with other sciences. Thus, we recommend reading the first five chapters of that section before continuing (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('b5efc8f9-c268-430f-9681-7a43848ee48e'); return false;\"><i>History Tracers Team. First Steps</i></a>).</p><p>Although in school we are introduced to subjects called Science or Physics before entering university, teaching often limits itself to presenting only the initial stages of this field. These stages could be referred to as proto-Physics or pre-Physics, as proposed by Dr. Francisco González A. Redondo (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('cd61bc64-1358-4bfd-b343-3629facaa3b4'); return false;\"><i>González Redondo, Francisco A., <htdate0></i></a>; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('abc894b4-61b2-4f0f-a145-9d591cda41d2'); return false;\"><i>González Redondo, Francisco A., <htdate1></i></a>; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('d6a6b284-a060-4a85-bc6c-9d2fe442254c'); return false;\"><i>González Redondo, Francisco A., <htdate2></i></a>; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('81e9393b-d5b6-4b04-91bd-417e943d3e97'); return false;\"><i>History Tracers Team, The knowledge</i></a>).</p></p>In the texts of this section, we present the concepts of pre-Physics and proto-Physics, gradually connecting them to Physics through mathematics.</p>",
