Before to do it, please, think and answer: do the size, the mass, of something affect the noise it can do?</p><p class=\"lab\"><b>Practice 1: Applying the method to test noise</b><br />Get a small box made of a material that makes noise when something hits it.<br /><br />Now choose three small objects. These objects should be smaller than the box size, for example, a bean, a small rock, and a cotton.<br /><br />Now get a sheet of paper. Write down the name of the object, the kind of noise you expect the object will do, and write next to it a number between 1 and 3 to define the sound level, when compared with other objects for example:<br /><b>Cotton - small noise - 1</b><br /><br />This sheet of paper has your hypothesis now. Let us test it. Put only one object at a time inside the box, close it, and shake it. Now check if your results are according to your notes.<br /><br />If the results are according to them, your hypothesis was confirmed. If the experiment showed an issue with the order, we have to update the initial order. When we have a completely different result, we have to discard the hypothesis.</p><p>After this first practice, you could observe that bigger objects are noisier than smaller objects, but the science does not end here. We only ended the first experiment. Let's do a second experiment:</p><p class=\"lab\"><b>Practice 2: Confirming the result</b><br />Get a small box made of a material that makes noise when something hits it.<br /><br />Now choose three small objects. These objects should be smaller than the box size. Prefer to change all previous objects, for example, a rice, a little sugar, and a small sheet of kneading paper.<br /><br />Now writes an ordered list like the practice 1.<br /><br />Do the practice of shake the objects again, one at a time, and check if your results are according to the hypothesis.</p><p>Every step made during these practices are also made by scientists when they are studying a phenomenon. When a scientist ends a research, he submits a paper for a magazine, that sends his paper to other people to try to repeat your finds, if they are able, your paper is published.</p><p>What happens when a researcher shows that another previous research was \"wrong\"? We must take care when we use words like \"correct\" and \"wrong\", because we can have a new research showing limitation for previous finds, and this does not do the results wrong. For example, we should not discard Sir Isaac Newton's gravitational propose (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('9f86c1c9-1fd7-4d22-95f6-a1b5ed13b1ee'); return false;\">Newton, Isaac, 1686</a>) and start using only Albert Einstein's gravitational theory (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('902815ac-30e7-46d2-8883-57ad754c1630'); return false;\">Einstein Relativity Easy, 2017</a>), because the results of Sir Isaac Newton explain, phenomena observed on Earth (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('1df98dc5-523f-42ae-9a69-3e9410849ebb'); return false;\">Hossenfelder, Sabine, 2024</a> ; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('cd738b4d-32bd-4ea6-8aef-6653d961de19'); return false;\">Hossenfelder, Sabine, 2021</a> ; <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('76b636be-45db-4e52-8ecd-5c873344f926'); return false;\">Lincoln, Don, 2023</a>).</p><p>Are the scientific results \"only theory\"? The sentence \"only theory\", that tries to disqualify scientific results, is generally said by people that do not understand the scientific method, and sometimes, neither what they wish to be \"correct\". The science goal is neither to explain why something happens nor to overcome believes. The science idea is <b> to look for continuous knowledge</b>. It is to explain <b>how</b> everything can be happening. To have doubts about something, it is not an issue, to have doubts is opening a door to new knowledge. In daily basis we are always learning and testing the scientific theories and laws. When we find a limitation in some of them, we need to update with a new law or theory. This update does not exclude the previous, returning to it as a particular case. Let us take a look again at gravitational models. The Albert Einstein's theory, explain many phenomena around the universe, that cannot be explained with Sir Isaac Newton's gravitation, but when we bring Albert Einstein's theory to Earth, the theory must show the same results of Sir Isaac Newton's gravitation model.</p><p>This is a scientific dissemination project, so we also use in different moment the scientific method, below we list some examples: <ul><li>The family Tavares origin during centuries was associated to Fonseca's family, but researches of Manuel Abranches de Soveral and Jos√© Augusto de Sottomayor Pizarro showed us this is not possible (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('5089c690-497b-4f78-b85c-1835997d348c'); return false;\">History Tracers (2024): Tavares</a>).</li><li>The utilization of partial documentation, or to extract sentences of a context, conduct to mistakes.
