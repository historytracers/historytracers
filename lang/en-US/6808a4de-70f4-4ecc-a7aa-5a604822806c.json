On the other hand, when we try to measure what is narrated, we do not find exactly what is described, though we can often identify real characters or places. To make this clearer, let us revisit an example already presented in Appendix I of the *Understanding Texts* section of *History Tracers* (<htcite1>).\n\n#### A Sumer Epic\n\nIn Tablet XI of what we now know as the *Epic of Gilgamesh* (Figure 1) (<htcite2>), we see that Gilgamesh —a historical figure— is said to have conversed with Ut-Napishtim, who, according to the text, built a cubic structure that allowed him and his family to survive the flood (<htcite3>; <htcite4>; <htcite5>; <htcite6>)",

These interpretations may arise from a superficial analysis of complex events or from an attempt to centralize results according to a preference (<htcite2>).\n\nIt is important to note that these contradictions end up creating barriers that conflict with a fundamental principle of life — one that governs both areas of knowledge — expressed by Socrates millennia ago (<htcite3>; <hcite3>):",

One reason for this is the changes in the meanings of words over time, a phenomenon known as semantic change (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nAnother important point that can lead to inaccurate conclusions is assuming that something is always absent, such as abstraction in science, when in reality it is present (<htcite2>).

We observed that, despite an apparent disconnection between these fields of knowledge, it is in fact possible to find points of convergence.\n\nTo demonstrate this connection, we noted that although we cannot take measurements to confirm what is mentioned in Mesopotamian epics, it is possible to verify that floods did occur in the Middle East (<htcite1>). This fact points to convergence rather than exclusion between science and literature.\n\nFurthermore, we observed that the sciences, like literature, also possess abstractions that allow us to explain the world around us.\n\nThroughout the *Understanding Texts* section, we will continue to explore this harmonious relationship between literary works and the sciences.",
