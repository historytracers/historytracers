In countries without separation between churches and the state, people's documentation was made by churches and convents. It is possible to find inside these institutions: baptisms, marriages, death registers, testaments, and de genere et mobirus documents.</li><li>Governmental documents - they are different documents made by local government like: <ul><li>Land register: A document that gave to a person a land region.</li><li>Royal documents - documents made during a period where the central government had a king or queen <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillPrimarySource('a0fb89b0-34b3-485c-bd96-ec5c9b20d922'); return false;\">(Torre do Tombo, Chancelaria Régia)</a>. An example of these documents is the coat of arms, a document that we need to write some concerns, because some of them hide women ancestors, because there was the necessity to trace a linage exclusively with men.</li></ul> <li>Judicial documents - these documents can have ancestor names, mainly documents that were made during inquisitorial events.</li><li>Chronicles - they are texts given historical details in a specific region.</li></ul><p></p><p>The primary sources do not need to be written during the lifetime of the studied person. Examples of these primary sources written after person's death are due diligence for familiar of the holy office, for Third Order, and for 'Irmandade de Misericórdia'. In these documents, according to priest Joseph Mascarenhas, there was a deep investigation through various generations for people that wanted to join the institutions <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillPrimarySource('baab6f07-714e-40ca-abea-775fb55e1968'); return false;\">(Torre do Tombo, Tribunal do Santo Ofício: Conselho Geral, Habilitações, Pedro, mç. 25, doc. 476, img. 49)</a>.
