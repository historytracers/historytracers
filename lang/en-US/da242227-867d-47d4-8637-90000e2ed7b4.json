In some Mesoamerican cultures, buildings were constructed in stages, where each previous stage served as the foundation for the next level (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nWith this in mind, we can compare the structure of Temple 16 to the construction of a text in the following way:\n\n- The period from <htdate0> to <htdate1> represents the letters that form a syllable, which will eventually become part of a title.\n- The reign of Ruler 2 (<htdate2> - <htdate3>) corresponds to the first paragraph, which introduces the central idea of the text.\n- From the ruler 3 to the ruler 15 (<htdate3> to <htdate4>) the narrative develops. In some cases, the text may lack certain details, yet it hints at the possibility of more to come, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n- The period of the last ruler symbolizes the conclusion of the text.",
