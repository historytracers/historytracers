This vision apparently was kept in next centuries, but this is not the unique vision to exclude people that had influence on Iberia people.</p><p>It is also possible to find an exclusion vision among Arab sources like Ibn Khaldūn's work (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a893dd90-f199-4a89-a82a-d0bcb25bf2a6'); return false;\">Rosenthal, Franz, 1958</a>). When he describes the Negro people of Lamlam, that, according to his own words, were invaded and enslaved (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a893dd90-f199-4a89-a82a-d0bcb25bf2a6'); return false;\">Rosenthal, Franz, 1958, pp. 118-119</a>), he also talks about another group of <i>Homo sapiens</i> living beyond them to the South:</p><p> <ul class=\"citation\"><li><i>\"Beyond them to the south, there is no civilization in the proper sense.

Both people are treated as humans, but it is created an artificial distance between them, a \"rational\" group and another near to \"irrational animals\".</p><p>There is almost one millennium difference between the Roman Empire falls and Ibn Khaldūn's work, but we have similarity between the Roman people trying to be far from barbarians (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('7b9c164d-a727-49f1-8bad-53b0619812ff'); return false;\">Devallet, Suzanne, 2008, pp. 112</a>) and the Arab vision to differentiate the Sub-Sahara people from areas where Arab culture were spread (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a893dd90-f199-4a89-a82a-d0bcb25bf2a6'); return false;\">Rosenthal, Franz, 1958, pp. 119</a>).</p><p>The differentiation vision was present in Eurasia for centuries against near people that they know, so it would not be different when they meet the unknown.</p>"

When we take a look in history books it is possible to be confused thinking that this is not happening nowadays, but this is a reality that unfortunately did not change, an example of this is the social concept of \"race\" that does not have basis from biological science, but this is not a consensus, like Rose M.

Considering that this cycle of superiority and inferiority never ends, I am finishing this text with some questions to bring reflection: <ul><li>Do you have difficult assuming that everybody is equal, only having different preferences?</li><li>Why do you want to be superior to others?</li><li>Why is your vision correct while others are wrong?</li><li>Is there any fear in the present or in an uncertain future that forces you to classify your opinion correct instead of other opinion?</li></ul></p>"
