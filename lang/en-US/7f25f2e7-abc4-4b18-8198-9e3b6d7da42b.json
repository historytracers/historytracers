David E.

The understanding of superiority, it is not explicitly written, but it was not hidden by Saint José de Anchieta, that described Tibiriçá as a person with \"tanta madureza que não parecia homem do Brasil.\" (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillPrimarySource('ef2da4a7-021f-48d6-b8b5-5e343ceffbba'); return false;\">Anchieta, José de, Santo, 1933, pp. 187</a>).

When we take a look in history books it is possible to be confused thinking that this is not happening nowadays, but this is a reality that unfortunately did not change, an example of this is the social concept of \"race\" that does not have basis from biological science, but this is not a consensus, like Rose M.
