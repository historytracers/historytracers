In historical texts, nagu typically means \"region,\" but in this context, it carries an additional layer of meaning. The term also appears in the \"Flood Tablet,\" which recounts the story of Ut-Napishtim, who survived a great flood. By analyzing both texts, scholars have concluded that *nagu* likely refers to mountains",
