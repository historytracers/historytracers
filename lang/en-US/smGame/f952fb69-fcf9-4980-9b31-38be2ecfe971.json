Initially, Vila Real was not targeted by the Inquisition as he was living in France. However, upon his return to Portugal to receive a commendation, he became the subject of persecution, particularly due to his opposition to the Fisco Inquisitorial and the practices of the Holy Office tribunal. Before his arrest, he published a book later translated into Spanish under the title <i>El político Christianissimo</i>\n\nManuel Fernandes Vila Real was accused of being a \"slanderer, insulter, and obstructer of the Holy Office\". As was common, the tribunal employed extreme methods to coerce him into confessing that he was a Jew. Among these measures, they claimed he practiced regular fasting during his imprisonment, alleging that he ate fewer than five days per week for three consecutive years",
