In this example, we are going to prepare a corn tortilla.\n\nThe cultivation of corn is one of the oldest in the American continent (*Abya Yala*) (<htcite0>). The process of domesticating plants, although the term is more common for animals, also applies to plants. This process led to the repeated cultivation of the varieties that best met our needs. This allowed for the emergence of different species or types of beans and corns, as observed by Darwin in the 19th century (<htcite1>; <htcite2>).\n\nThis process of species (type of plants) selection by humans is known as artificial selection (<htcite3>). Through it, we choose the changes in plants that are most useful to us.\n\n#### Choices for Cooking\n\nWhen selecting the ears of corn from the stalk, we perform mathematical operations we have already learned.
