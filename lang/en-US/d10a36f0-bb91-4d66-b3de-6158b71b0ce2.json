The process of domesticating plants, although the term is more common for animals, also applies to plants. This process led to the repeated cultivation of the varieties that best met our needs. This allowed for the emergence of different species or types of beans and corns, as observed by Darwin in the 19th century (<htcite1>; <htcite2>).\n\nThis process of species (type of plants) selection by humans is known as artificial selection (<htcite3>). Through it, we choose the changes in plants that are most useful to us.\n\n#### Choices for Cooking\n\nWhen selecting the ears of corn from the stalk, we perform mathematical operations we have already learned.

However, our recipe only needs 175 grams to prepare 12 tortillas.\n\n#### Preparation\n\nWe separate 175 grams of flour from the total and place it in a container (**Figure 4**). Then, we add water little by little until the mixture reaches the desired consistency.\n\nFinally, we cook the dough on the griddle until it reaches the stage of a tortilla and is ready to serve.",
