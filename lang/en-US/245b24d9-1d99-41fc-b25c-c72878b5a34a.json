During the pre-imperial period, some texts did not express racial ideas, as some readers and researchers might assume. However, by the imperial period, the notion of Chinese superiority became more pronounced among certain imperial thinkers. This idea eventually culminated centuries later in the construction of the Great Wall and the end of cultural universalization",

The Greeks learned how to incorporate the knowledge of other peoples, integrating it into their own traditions.\n\n#### The Alphabet\n\nThe Greek alphabet, for example, was developed based on the Phoenician alphabet.

A clear example of this is the Eurocentric perspective that diminishes the achievements of Indigenous civilizations in the Americas (*Abya Yala*), often portraying them as societies that \"lived in the Stone Age.\" This viewpoint overlooks the technological and cultural advancements of these civilizations, as well as the lack of understanding in fields like anthropology and archaeology.
