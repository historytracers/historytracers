Despite the increased numbers, it remains possible to count them, albeit now requiring both hands.

With more individuals present for the meal, we also have more hands available to aid in enumeration and fruit gathering. We'll follow the same protocol we employed with our hands: initially raising fingers until one hand is full, then continuing with the other hand. Our guests can stand beside us and replicate this action. While this may suffice for a meal, it still doesn't address the limitations imposed by finger counting when dealing with larger harvests.</li></ul></p><p class=\"reflection\"><b>Reflection 2: Regarding enumeration</b><br />Building upon the concept that aligning hands or individuals side by side facilitates counting more effectively, we might explore representing our fingers symbolically.
