In light of this, we will take a “journey into the past” to understand what “world” really meant in ancient times.\n\n#### The Modern World\n\nThe modern world is studied in detail in the *History Tracers Atlas* (<htcite0>). From this atlas, we use **Figure 1**, which shows the continent of Antarctica, located at the southernmost point of Earth, with the regions of South America (*Abya Yala*), Africa, and Australia also visible.

As we go back in time, we notice that the model of the planet was directly linked to knowledge of specific regions.\n\n#### Different Views\n\nWhen discussing the concept of “world,” we must specify not only the historical period but also the geographical region being referred to.\n\nLooking at Africa and the Middle East, for example, we know that Eratosthenes, in Egypt, measured the Earth’s dimensions, offering for the first time the idea that the planet had a spherical shape (<htcite2>). More than a thousand years later, Al-Biruni measured the Earth’s radius again, this time using a lunar eclipse (<htcite3>; <htcite4>; <htcit5>).\n\nLas regiones donde se realizaron estas mediciones de esfericidad se muestran en la **Figure 2**.",

These writings claimed that one could reach the “heavens” by climbing something large, like a tree (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\n#### How Do Anachronisms Occur?\n\nAfter presenting these facts, we can conclude that anachronism occurs when:\n- When reading references to “world” and “underworld” in Mesoamerica, we assume that these peoples understood the planet as spherical and the universe as we know it today.\n- When we state that “we have known the world is spherical since <htdate0>...”, without considering that communication in the past was much slower and contact among peoples very limited — making generalizations incorrect.\n- When interpreting references to “world” in Middle Eastern or European texts written before Eratosthenes’s measurements as equivalent to our modern concept of the planet.\n\nThe last case of anachronism becomes clear when we superimpose the ancient Babylonian world map onto the modern world map (**Figura 4**). It is evident that the Babylonian depiction represents a local world, not the entire planet as we conceive it today (<htcite4>; <htcite5>; <htcite6>; <htcite7>).",
