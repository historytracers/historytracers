In this classification, we can observe that we humans were initially classified together with other simians (monkeys) as primates: animals with large brains, stereoscopic binocular vision—the brain's ability to integrate images obtained by the eyes—and hands adapted for grasping objects (<htcite2>).\n\nThe classification as primates alongside other animals was not the only advance brought by Carl Linnaeus. In his classification, we also see that primates are placed within a larger group, called mammals (*Mammalia primate*), together with other mammals, such as elephants, which would belong to *Mammalia bruta*, among others (<htcite3>).\n\nThis classification of living beings into groups follows the same pattern we use to classify numbers:\n- **Species**: as mentioned earlier, are represented by natural numbers, which identify them uniquely;\n- **Primates and Bruta**: are the rational numbers, with each representing, in this text, 1/2;\n- **Mammals**: cannot be classified as real numbers because, in our examples, we are limiting ourselves to some animals, and reality does not have only mammals, but also other animals and kingdoms, like plants. Thus, we will use rational numbers in the representation of mammals, expanding the total (denominator of the fractions).",

Your studies should not stop here. Seek more information that can be tested to better understand, and if something is unclear, look for us on our social media to clarify doubts.

Indeed, the distinction between these species has been a source of confusion in the past. Besides the difficulties in distinguishing between them, it should be noted that the species exhibits characteristics more akin to *Australiptecus africanus* than to *Homo sapiens*, such as its dental development, which indicates a greater need for bite force for feeding (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).\n\nTo aid in understanding phylogeny—the history of the evolution and derivation of various groups of organisms over time (<htcite5>))—for each species viewed we will place the human skeleton and the found skeletons of the species side by side, followed by a practice.",

Firstly, we highlight that it is the smallest of all human species, with an estimated body weight of only 34 kilograms (<htcite0>). Another significant fact about this species is that it was the first to successfully modify stones into tools (<htcite1>).\n\nTo date, this species has been found in regions of Kenya and Tanzania, dating from approximately <htdate0> and <htdate1>. In Kenya, it was even found at the same site as *Homo rudolfensis*, on the shores of Lake Turkana (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nLike *Homo rudolfensis*, it is not currently possible to consider this species an ancestor of modern humans, although it was previously considered as such (<htcite4>).",

In this way, we always suggest seeing the depth of our knowledge, rather than limiting it to a superficial duality (<htcite0>).\n\nThe advancement of knowledge first allowed us to confirm that we were facing a new species of the genus *Homo*, *Homo erectus*. Furthermore, Homo erectus skeletons were found in Africa, although some researchers consider that these should be classified as *Homo ergaster* (<htcite1>; <htcite2>; <htcite3>). With the continuation of studies by different researchers, it was possible to prove that the genus *Homo* would have emerged in Africa around <htdate0> and <htdate1> (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).",

A fossil dated to <htdate2> shows that the species had reached what is now Georgia (<htcite4>).\n\nThe fossil known as **KNM-WT 15000**, or *Niño de Turkana* (**Figure 13**), is the best-preserved fossil among all the species we have studied so far, allowing for better identification of characteristics common with other species.",

Despite the presence of *Homo erectus* over 1 million years ago in the Far East of the Asian continent—China (Zhongguo 中國) and Java—when we look at Europe, the evidence is more recent. Furthermore, it is understood that it should not have been a *Homo erectus*, but rather a new species known as *Homo antecessor* (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nThe relationship of *Homo atencessor* to us is not exactly known, with some proposing it could be a common ancestor of *Homo neanderthalensis* and us, *Homo sapiens*. However, there are also those who claim it would be on a sister lineage. Some dental and cranial characteristics suggest it would be a descendant of *Homo ergaster*, indicating it migrated through what we now call the Middle East to Europe (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nAs we do not have a photo of the Homo antecessor fossil, we will limit ourselves to stating that it lived between <htdate0> and <htdate1> and will take the opportunity to reflect on everything discussed, including on a species mentioned but not detailed in this text.",

The first two species became extinct, while others speciated, including the one that would become ours. Despite the temporal distance between us and them, it is still possible to find similarities among the three skulls.<br /><br />In our time, with the discovery of DNA and its function, it became possible to go further and conduct DNA analysis on fossils, as well as on other species still alive. In the comparison between us (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) and chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), for example, it was possible to observe a genetic difference of about 1.24% after approximately 8 million years of separation (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).<br /><br />1. During the practices we conducted comparing extinct animals and ourselves, did it occur to you that we were also close to animals still alive?<br />2. Looking at chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) (<b>Figura 15</b>) and the skeletons in <b>Figura 14</b>, which species would they be closer to?<br /><br />If it is possible to measure the proximity of species through DNA, it is also possible to estimate when a certain characteristic ceased to be common among living beings. For example, the tail present in smaller monkeys likely ceased to be present in species like ours and the chimpanzee's about 25 million years ago (<htcite2>). Even so, Mesoamerican indigenous peoples managed to see a proximity between monkeys with tails and us (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).<br /><br />3. Would the observation of nature have helped Mesoamerican indigenous peoples have an understanding close to what we have today about the relationship between us and monkeys?<br /><br />4. In the past, could humans who lived in places with a nature completely different from that of Mesoamerica have had a different understanding of how our species arose?</div></div></center></p>",
