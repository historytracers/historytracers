In this classification, we can observe that we humans were initially classified together with other simians (monkeys) as primates: animals with large brains, stereoscopic binocular vision—the brain's ability to integrate images obtained by the eyes—and hands adapted for grasping objects (<htcite2>).\n\nThe classification as primates alongside other animals was not the only advance brought by Carl Linnaeus. In his classification, we also see that primates are placed within a larger group, called mammals (*Mammalia primate*), together with other mammals, such as elephants, which would belong to *Mammalia bruta*, among others (<htcite3>).\n\nThis classification of living beings into groups follows the same pattern we use to classify numbers:\n- **Species**: as mentioned earlier, are represented by natural numbers, which identify them uniquely;\n- **Primates and Bruta**: are the rational numbers, with each representing, in this text, 1/2;\n- **Mammals**: cannot be classified as real numbers because, in our examples, we are limiting ourselves to some animals, and reality does not have only mammals, but also other animals and kingdoms, like plants. Thus, we will use rational numbers in the representation of mammals, expanding the total (denominator of the fractions).",

From now on, we will study some species listed in **Chart 2**, trying to better understand why they are close to us, but are not us.\n\nThis text is long because we are trying to resolve various confusions that arise when dealing with our origins. Your studies should not stop here. Seek more information that can be tested to better understand, and if something is unclear, look for us on our social media to clarify doubts. Only by understanding what is unclear will it be possible to improve.\n\nIn the sequence of the text, there is a list of patriarchs and matriarchs where expressions like “Family: *Homo rudolfensis*” appear. These expressions should not be mistaken for biological families, which constitute a broader concept within taxonomy (<htcite0>). All species presented on this page belong to the same biological family, *Hominidae*.",

Indeed, the distinction between these species has been a source of confusion in the past. Besides the difficulties in distinguishing between them, it should be noted that the species exhibits characteristics more akin to *Australiptecus africanus* than to *Homo sapiens*, such as its dental development, which indicates a greater need for bite force for feeding (<htcite3>; <htcite4>).\n\nTo aid in understanding phylogeny—the history of the evolution and derivation of various groups of organisms over time (<htcite5>))—for each species viewed we will place the human skeleton and the found skeletons of the species side by side, followed by a practice.",

Another significant fact about this species is that it was the first to successfully modify stones into tools (<htcite1>).\n\nTo date, this species has been found in regions of Kenya and Tanzania, dating from approximately <htdate0> and <htdate1>. In Kenya, it was even found at the same site as *Homo rudolfensis*, on the shores of Lake Turkana (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nLike *Homo rudolfensis*, it is not currently possible to consider this species an ancestor of modern humans, although it was previously considered as such (<htcite4>).",

A fossil dated to <htdate2> shows that the species had reached what is now Georgia (<htcite4>).\n\nThe fossil known as **KNM-WT 15000**, or *Niño de Turkana* (**Figure 13**), is the best-preserved fossil among all the species we have studied so far, allowing for better identification of characteristics common with other species.",

Despite the presence of *Homo erectus* over 1 million years ago in the Far East of the Asian continent—China (Zhongguo 中國) and Java—when we look at Europe, the evidence is more recent. Furthermore, it is understood that it should not have been a *Homo erectus*, but rather a new species known as *Homo antecessor* (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nThe relationship of *Homo atencessor* to us is not exactly known, with some proposing it could be a common ancestor of *Homo neanderthalensis* and us, *Homo sapiens*. However, there are also those who claim it would be on a sister lineage. Some dental and cranial characteristics suggest it would be a descendant of *Homo ergaster*, indicating it migrated through what we now call the Middle East to Europe (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nAs we do not have a photo of the Homo antecessor fossil, we will limit ourselves to stating that it lived between <htdate0> and <htdate1> and will take the opportunity to reflect on everything discussed, including on a species mentioned but not detailed in this text.",

The first two species became extinct, while others speciated, including the one that would become ours. Despite the temporal distance between us and them, it is still possible to find similarities among the three skulls.<br /><br />In our time, with the discovery of DNA and its function, it became possible to go further and conduct DNA analysis on fossils, as well as on other species still alive. In the comparison between us (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) and chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), for example, it was possible to observe a genetic difference of about 1.24% after approximately 8 million years of separation (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>).<br /><br />1. During the practices we conducted comparing extinct animals and ourselves, did it occur to you that we were also close to animals still alive?<br />2. Looking at chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) (<b>Figura 15</b>) and the skeletons in <b>Figura 14</b>, which species would they be closer to?<br /><br />If it is possible to measure the proximity of species through DNA, it is also possible to estimate when a certain characteristic ceased to be common among living beings. For example, the tail present in smaller monkeys likely ceased to be present in species like ours and the chimpanzee's about 25 million years ago (<htcite3>). Even so, Mesoamerican indigenous peoples managed to see a proximity between monkeys with tails and us (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).<br /><br />3. Would the observation of nature have helped Mesoamerican indigenous peoples have an understanding close to what we have today about the relationship between us and monkeys?<br /><br />4. In the past, could humans who lived in places with a nature completely different from that of Mesoamerica have had a different understanding of how our species arose?</div></div></center></p>",

Among the characteristics we would like to highlight is a brain much closer in size to ours, between 1120 and 1285 ml (<htcite3>).\n\nFran Dorey from the Australian Museum highlighted something we would like to draw attention to (<htcite4>):",

In <htdate0>, a new species was found in the Dinaledi Chamber in South Africa (<htcite0>), which, in addition to confirming human expansion across the African continent, brought additional reflections about a habit we believed was not possible for ancient species.\n\n*Homo naledi* shares characteristics with both *Australopithecus* species and different *Homo*, as can be observed in various parts of its skeleton. For example, its dentition is very close to that of the first *Homo* species presented on this page, meaning it does not have the powerful chewing typical of *Australopithecus* and *Paranthropus*. Generally speaking, it can be stated that the species “combines a body size and stature similar to humans with a brain the size of an *Australopithecus*” (<htcite1>).\n\nThe dating of the *Homo naledi* fossils occurred separately from the discovery of the fossils. They were dated to between <htdate1> and <htdate2> (<htcite2>). Despite the later dating, a comment in the original article should be highlighted: “…A date younger than 1 million years ago would demonstrate the coexistence of multiple *Homo*” (<htcite3>).\n\nThis relationship between different species, proven by the dating of *Homo naledi*, is also represented in our numerical systems (**Figura 17**) (<htcite3>).",

There is something more that needs to be addressed about this species, as it breaks some paradigms. When analyzing the found remains of *Homo naledi*, it is not possible to identify food remains, tools, or signs of fire alongside them. Nor is it possible to infer that predators brought the bones to the location. Finally, there is no evidence that the remains were naturally transported to the chamber where they were found. Given these scenarios, it is possible to conclude that *Homo naledi* used the location as burial chambers (<htcite0>).\n\nThe possible burial chambers also point to another possibility. Due to the depth where the remains were found, it cannot be ruled out that these individuals also controlled fire, all without possessing a brain the size of ours (<htcite1>).",

               "text": "This is perhaps the species of the genus *Homo* best known to the general public besides our own, after all, it shares many similarities with us. Starting with the fact that its brain size is comparable to ours (<htcite0>). In addition to its scientific name, *Homo neanderthalensis*, it is not uncommon to see them referred to as Neanderthals (<htcite1>).\n\nBased on the data known to date, it is understood that the species inhabited planet Earth between <htdate0> and <htdate1> (<htcite2>; <htcite3>), meaning it emerged in a period very close to our own.\n\nRegarding its distribution on planet Earth, we know that it populated regions such as Europe, the Levant, and Asia (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).\n\nThe fact that Neanderthals went extinct recently and lived in colder regions of the planet allowed us to go beyond skeletal comparisons and also compare them genetically, even through mitochondrial DNA — DNA passed down from generation to generation from mother to child in different animals (<htcite6>)— which enabled us to draw some conclusions about their relationship with us and with chimpanzees (<htcite7>; <htcite8>; <htcite9>; <htcite10>):\n- Matthias Krings and his team used data inferring that our separation from chimpanzees occurred around 4 to 5 million years ago. However, as knowledge is constantly expanding, I. Ebersberger and his team estimated, years later, that the time of separation between the lineages occurred around 7 to 8 million years ago.\n- The coexistence between Neanderthals and modern humans lasted for a period of approximately 40,000 years.\n- Due to the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA, the divergence between us and Neanderthals occurred before the existence of the most recent common ancestor of the modern human mtDNA gene pool.\n- Europeans and Asians share about 1% to 4% of DNA sequence with Neanderthals; the same is not observed among Africans. This indicates that interbreeding between the species possibly occurred after the exit from Africa and before an expansion of our species into Europe and Asia.\n- By comparing a small part of Neanderthal mtDNA with other species, it was possible to observe that the average difference between humans is only 8, while between humans and chimpanzees it is 55, and between modern humans and Neanderthals it is 26. These data indicate that the separation between our lineage and the Neanderthal lineage possibly occurred between <htdate2> and <htdate3>.\n\nAlthough the data show that Neanderthals and humans had relationships with each other, there is a point raised by Wu Liu and his team that cannot go unmentioned. Although research indicates that competition between Neanderthals and our species may have led to their extinction, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the presence of our species in China (Zhongguo 中國), millennia before we inhabited Europe, is a result of Neanderthals acting as an ecological barrier to the entry of *Homo sapiens* in Europe (<htcite11>).",

Furthermore, in the past, it was proposed that haplogroup D could have originated among Neanderthals and been passed on to humans. However, a fossil studied in Europe demonstrates that this would not be likely (<htcite0>).\n\nWhat has been presented in this text about Neanderthals constitutes only a small part of our knowledge about them. In light of this, in addition to the articles mentioned, we recommend the work of Don Hitchcock, which, besides detailing their culture, provides various photos of their natural habitat, tools, and reconstructions of the species (<htcite1>).",

This species was found in caves in the Altai region of Russia, but with few bones preserved. Thus, it is the first human species known only through DNA (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nDating of its period of existence was done primarily indirectly, through cave sediments and also through its DNA. These measurements indicate that the species inhabited the region around the period between <htdate0> and <htdate1>. They were not alone in the region, which also contained modern humans like us and Neanderthals (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).\n\nTheir genetic history is very broad, with Tibetans, East Asian populations, Australians, Papuans from New Guinea, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas (*Abya Yala*) containing DNA originating from this population (<htcite4>; <htcite5>).\n\nOne final note about this species and its relationship with us and with Neanderthals: genetic results show that they possibly shared a common ancestor with us around <htdate2>, and that the common ancestor between them and Neanderthals dates to about <htdate3>; meaning Denisovans and Neanderthals are sister lineages (<htcite6>).",

               "text": "When we encounter something unusual, it is not abnormal for it to cause us surprise. In some cases, it can even lead us to denial. When something new is real, like a fossil, the scenario becomes even more interesting, as denial becomes unviable, leading us to search for answers.\n\nSince the discovery of the *Homo floresiensis*, fossil in <htdate0>, different proposals have been presented for this new fossil. And this was no accident; after all, we are faced with a small skeleton of the genus *Homo* at Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia (**Figure 20**), which defied any pattern observed for other known species of the genus *Homo* that migrated to Asia. Some even claimed it could be a \"*Homo* with a physical disorder\" (<htcite0>). In this text, respecting the scientists who still support or proposed the disorder hypothesis, we will treat the findings as belonging to a new species.\n\nThe discovery of the first skeleton was not the only one found on the island. Thanks to other findings, the body structure was confirmed, allowing these remains to be treated with more certainty as belonging to a new species (<htcite1>).\n\nOnce the fact that it was a species was consolidated, the problem remained of how to accommodate it in our phylogenetic tree. One of the explanations presented proposed that it might not be related to *Homo erectus*, but rather to a still unknown species (<htcite2>).\n\nIn <htdate1>, new findings made it possible to better understand this species. Teeth similar to those of *Homo floresiensis* were found in the So'a Basin, in central Flores, dated to around <htdate2>. Thus, it was no longer possible to dismiss that these individuals could be descended from ancient *Homo erectus* from Java, who arrived in the region around <htdate3>. This connection is further reinforced by evidence of the first human occupation in Flores, dated to approximately <htdate4>, that is, after the arrival in Java. Finally, as demonstrated by G. D. van den Bergh et al., the teeth found, smaller than those of previous *Homo floresienses*, could indicate that there was a small growth over time and, furthermore, intrapopulation changes in an isolated group (<htcite3>).",

However, before we begin this study, some points related to other species and to us must be highlighted:\n- Our species is the eleventh species of the genus *Homo* that we will study;\n- As shown in *Graph 2* and throughout the text, our species did not appear on planet Earth at the same time as the others;\n- As can be seen in various figures on this page, the body structure of the species of the genus *Homo* is similar, as a result of shared DNA among us and, as seen, with other species, such as chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*) (<htcite0>);\n- The fact that DNA is shared with other species can be confirmed when DNA can be extracted from fossils of species that went extinct recently (<htcite1>). When it is no longer possible to extract it, we can still compare the final result, which are the fossils;\n- The understanding of DNA occurred only in the 20th century (<htcite2>), according to the Gregorian calendar. This did not prevent people like Charles Darwin (<htcite3>; <htcite4>; <htcite5>) from proposing beforehand what DNA later confirmed;\n- Regarding the evolution of the knowledge and beliefs that characterize us, an observation must be made about the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica (*Abya Yala*). Although we cannot refer to them as users of the scientific method, we must highlight that they were able to see the relationship between us and other monkeys within their worldview (<htcite6>; <htcite7>).\n- Finally, regardless of the specific characteristics of the 11 species of the genus *Homo*, millions of years ago we separated from other species—in a process of speciation. This process continued thanks to genetic mutations. And we, *Homo sapiens*, who occupy the entire planet today, have our origins in Africa (<htcite8>).",

As demonstrated by Alan R. Templeton in his research, geographical separations influenced genetic diversity among human populations. However, when compared to the races of chimpanzees—the species closest to us in terms of DNA today—these variations are so small, less than 5%, that the concept of races among us, *Homo sapiens*, loses meaning (<htcite0>; <htcite1>).\n\nAlthough we still have data on some individuals to present, this is the last paragraph dealing with humans scattered across planet Earth. Humans who, as we have seen, are not limited to *Homo sapiens*. Everything presented here is very little compared to our knowledge about the species and will most likely be even less by the time you are reading this text, as we constantly discover more data not only about ourselves but about the universe as a whole.\n\nDo not limit yourself to this text; we suggest you continue studying and updating your knowledge constantly to learn even more. Limiting yourself to a single source is the “best” way to remain unaware of the whole picture.\n\nTo reinforce the practice of study, we will not complete **Table 1** in this text, but we point to the works of Don Hitchcock and the Australian Museum as next steps (<htcite2>; <htcite3>).",
