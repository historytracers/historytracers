Light, since it does not interact with this specific field, has no mass (<htcite0>).

This implies that the universe — and we, who are made of the same matter that constitutes it — have at least three dimensions.\n\nIn addition, we saw that we cannot reduce the universe to a simple plane, because of the depth it presents. We also observed that, although at times we have divided certain things into only two regions — such as “heaven and Earth” — as our knowledge and human interactions advanced, we were compelled to create new divisions. This has led us, among other consequences, to having today more than 190 countries in the world.\n\nFinally, we understood that reducing something to just two sides can be a way of limiting ourselves and of going against our very own nature.",
