Do you remember when I mistakenly believed that \"truth\" remained static over time?</li><li>I extend my thanks to Vinicius da Fonseca for providing genealogical data from his research, which played a crucial role in confirming alterations to the history of a common ancestor.</li><li>To my cousin Saulo Franco, whose insightful genealogical blog (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('af0abd94-6e1d-40d3-a593-4448f2d2affc'); return false;\">Genealogia e Origens</a>)  and published works on our family have been instrumental. Our discussions have been instrumental in rectifying errors in our research. Thank you for inspiring me to create this project.</li><li>I've come to understand that genealogy cannot solely rely on documentation in today's context. This insight was imparted by the geographer, local historical researcher, and genetic genealogist Celito Regmendes. Additionally, I'm indebted to the valuable lessons provided by Eduardo Santos-Lima. Thank you teachers!</li><li>After years of studying physics and other sciences, I found myself lacking in certain grammatical concepts. I've also noticed shifts in previously acquired knowledge, as language is dynamic. While some texts may contain grammatical errors, one thing remains certain: I've significantly enhanced my linguistic prowess, all thanks to my dear cousin Adalberto Camargo. Thank you!</li><li>We all fall into the trap of complacency at times, and having someone to challenge us is a blessing. Over the past years, my dear cousin Eduardo Olifer has been instrumental in shaking me out of this state, contributing to our collective knowledge of our ancestors. Thank you!</li><li>Upon the passing of my beloved cousin, Avelina Maria Noronha de Almeida, our family lost a historian who illuminated our history. The impact of her absence was profound, initially dissuading me from continuing her work. However, months later, a message from genealogist Gilber Rubim Rangel on WhatsApp changed everything. His invitation to contribute to GENEA - Revista Capixaba de Genealogia reignited my passion and determination. Thank you, Gilber!</li><li>No individual can possess all available knowledge, and receiving assistance in this pursuit is invaluable. The resources utilized in constructing this project are a culmination of lessons learned from various individuals, some of whom I've already acknowledged, and others I list below: <ul><li>Thank you to teacher Maximiliano Pessôa for consistently providing me with books and genealogical trees that have proven immensely helpful.</li><li>I'm also grateful to Suzana V. Stucka for her thoughtfulness in remembering my lineage to the Leme family and providing material from an unexplored region.</li></ul> </li><li>Preserving documentation of our ancestors is always a pleasure, but paper can deteriorate over time.

These journeys introduced me to Indigenous communities, who, despite being distant relatives, imparted invaluable wisdom. In recent months, I've developed a close relationship with Ludwig Nguillatun, a member of the Mapuche Indigenous community, with whom I engage in almost daily conversations. He has been a driving force behind the creation of the \"Who ...?\" section, where individuals learn to contemplate diverse topics. I am deeply grateful to him for his inspiration.</li><li>The desire to write about our Indigenous heritage has been with me for over a decade, yet uncertainty surrounded the approach. Thankfully, this year, <htdate0>, Roberto Moras, creator of the channels <i>America: Lo que no te contaron</i> and <i>Crónicas Prohibidas de América</i> (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a082a3ed-59c7-4ae2-9f5a-eecef36c7409'); return false;\">Moras, Roberto.

Through our discussions over the past few months, I've gained clarity on how to proceed with this project. Rather than viewing it as competition, I see it as a complementary effort to enrich his work. I extend my sincere appreciation to Roberto Moras for his invaluable contributions.</li><li>While our initial research focused on the American (<i>Abya Yala</i>) continent, is committed to treating all people equally, thus we cannot overlook other continents. We are immensely grateful to Cy for sharing knowledge about other regions of the world on his channel (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('0b224dab-cd7c-4bec-ac24-5eac7dd42b9b'); return false;\">Cy, History with Cy</a>).</li><li>After decades of exclusively working with numerical and mathematical methods originating from Eurasia, in <htdate1> we were introduced to a new methodology developed by the Incas: the 'Yupana Inka', and its application through the <i>\"Yupana Inka Tawa Pukllay\"</i> method. Firstly, we would like to extend our congratulations to Dhavit Prem (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('2d2ea4a5-506b-4dbf-aaa4-3a10a8fbbd9c'); return false;\">Prem, Dhavit</a>) and Yupanki Association for their remarkable scientific research, and naturally, we express our gratitude for sharing this knowledge with the world (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('68dc1424-a27a-4253-88c8-e3d099ed3a50'); return false;\">Yupana Inka, <htdate2></a>).</li><li>The Mesoamerican Indigenous play a significant role in shaping this project. While numerous papers have been published about them, there remains a vast expanse of their history waiting to be uncovered. I extend my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Orlando Josué Casares Contreras (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('20ccab88-a64c-447d-a2e6-907bad845c0e'); return false;\">Casares Contreras, Orlando Josué</a>), José M Gamboa Cetina, Venus Sarahí Estrella Cabrera (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('31910324-f1cb-4326-876f-d93b18c9514f'); return false;\">Estrella Cabrera, Venus Sarahí</a>), and the team at INAH-MX for their invaluable research and dissemination efforts concerning these cultures.</li><li>Due the fact I am from exact sciences, I recognize I am still in adaptation to work with some data from Humana sciences, this conduct me to be assertive when I should be reflexive. I am thankful to Roberto Palomino for your help to identify in some texts the mistakes I had.</li><li>Understanding the past, especially in contexts lacking documentation and chronicles that describe how people lived, is always a challenge. In such situations, contributions from specialists in diverse fields are essential. For this reason, we extend our congratulations and gratitude to Dr. Ximena Catepillán, whose work has significantly enhanced our understanding of the mathematics of Mesoamerican Indigenous cultures (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('9e9dc5b2-7add-43dc-8736-41cf7dfcb27d'); return false;\">Dr. Ximena Catepillán</a>).</li><li>Although Indigenous cultures are extremely rich and possess an admirable history, information about them is still scarcely disseminated in schools. This highlights the need to create institutions that broadly promote this knowledge and legacy.

Therefore, we are grateful to Font Awesome for sharing a version of the project for free (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('ad0cdae3-2260-4462-86a7-0987c6ffc82b'); return false;\">Font Awesome</a>).</li><li>Inclusive education is only possible when there is a deep understanding of people's needs. In addition, it is essential to have tools that enable us to connect with them. We are thankful to the developers of Piper (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('45a8caaa-2f92-482a-8ac6-88310105c387'); return false;\">Piper</a>) for creating a tool that allows us to convert text into audio.</li><li>Understanding your own history is an incredible way to explore different sciences, but creating your own genealogical tree is not a simple task. We are grateful to the developers of Gramps for creating an open-source tool that helps us achieve this goal (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a8131139-6535-47f6-be78-08c9c53ea514'); return false;\">Gramps Project</a>).</li><li>Software development goes beyond just writing algorithms. Among the languages chosen for this project, Go deserves special mention for its libraries and cross-platform compatibility (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('124dbf75-6132-4dac-ba15-42a7954e4e87'); return false;\">GO</a>).</li></ul></p>",
