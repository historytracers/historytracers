Thank you teachers!</li><li>After years of studying physics and other sciences, I found myself lacking in certain grammatical concepts.

The impact of her absence was profound, initially dissuading me from continuing her work. However, months later, a message from genealogist Gilber Rubim Rangel on WhatsApp changed everything. His invitation to contribute to GENEA - Revista Capixaba de Genealogia reignited my passion and determination. Thank you, Gilber!</li><li>No individual can possess all available knowledge, and receiving assistance in this pursuit is invaluable. The resources utilized in constructing this project are a culmination of lessons learned from various individuals, some of whom I've already acknowledged, and others I list below: <ul><li>Thank you to teacher Maximiliano Pessôa for consistently providing me with books and genealogical trees that have proven immensely helpful.</li><li>I'm also grateful to Suzana V.

These journeys introduced me to Indigenous communities, who, despite being distant relatives, imparted invaluable wisdom. In recent months, I've developed a close relationship with Ludwig Nguillatun, a member of the Mapuche Indigenous community, with whom I engage in almost daily conversations. He has been a driving force behind the creation of the \"Who ...?\" section, where individuals learn to contemplate diverse topics. I am deeply grateful to him for his inspiration.</li><li>The desire to write about our Indigenous heritage has been with me for over a decade, yet uncertainty surrounded the approach. Thankfully, this year, <span id=\"htdate1\"></span>,  Roberto Moras, from the Legado Ancestral YouTube channel (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('a082a3ed-59c7-4ae2-9f5a-eecef36c7409'); return false;\">Moras, Roberto.
