I grew up listening that I had Indigenous ancestors, but people were hidden Afro ancestors, on the other hand, I also heard that part of the family were European, when they had various indigenous. Why do we have necessity to select ancestors? What is the issue with accepting all?</p><p>When we are children, we ask a lot of questions, but sometimes repression builds a barrier that does not allow us to proceed. When we receive a simple [and wrong] answer for difficult problems, we relax and accept. Parallel reality (bubble) are made for people to stay inside, because they have what people want. Should we proceed asking? Should we have doubts?</p><p>Today this project is released, to teach, and help people with their questions.</p><p>Have fun with knowledge!</p>" ]
