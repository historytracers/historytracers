According to this proposal, the people were Semitic, with possible connections to the House of David (<htcite1>). This fact leads us to a reflection:",

Similarly, it is possible that at Great Zimbabwe, some kings were also replaced by their brothers, as was the case in the Mutapa State (<htcite1>).\n\n#### Foreign trade\n\nAt Great Zimbabwe, ceramics have been found that provide evidence of import practices by the Shona people (<htcite2>). Among the ceramics identified in the region, pieces originating from China stand out, which still generate controversy among experts due to the difficulties in dating them precisely (<htcite3>; <htcite4>; <htcite5>).\n\nTrade between China and African peoples is still being mapped. It is currently likely that this trade began when Persians and Chinese started their imperial expansions, around the 7th century, according to the Gregorian calendar. During this period, Chinese ceramics could have reached Arabia and, subsequently, Africa (<htcite6>).\n\nIn her work, Bing Zhao explains that the arrival of Chinese ceramics in East Africa can possibly be divided into four distinct periods (<htcite7>):\n- **Phase 1 (<htdate0> - <htdate1>/<htdate2>)**: In addition to Chinese ceramics, Tang dynasty coins can be found.\n- **Phase 2 (<htdate3>/<htdate4> - <htdate5>/<htdate6>)**: Chinese pieces ceased to be exported exclusively in sealed containers. Besides jars, open pieces, such as small plates, began to appear.\n- **Phase 3 (<htdate7>/<htdate8> - <htdate9>/<htdate10>)**: Increase in the occurrence of medium-sized plates, with continuous growth in the number of plates and bowls that would reach more than 35 centimeters in diameter.\n - **Phase 4 (<htdate11>/<htdate12> - <htdate13>/<htdate14>)**: Predominance of blue-and-white porcelain pieces, as well as green-glazed porcelain, as demonstrated in Bing Zhao's work.\n\nAccording to the studies of Dr. B. Zhao, the ceramics found in Zimbabwe would belong to **Phase 3** of the expansion of Chinese trade with the region.",

Even if we cannot name them yet, we know their haplogroup is E1b1a* (<htcite0>; <htcite1>; <htcite2>), which is why, in this final section of the text, we chose to focus on a male figure.\n\nOne final point we would like to highlight, emphasized in one of the articles used in this text, is the small number of studies related to many regions of Africa (<htcite3>). As a direct consequence, we still have much to discover about the people who have lived for millennia in these regions. On the other hand, due to a lack of data in classrooms or everyday conversations, it is also possible to reach mistaken conclusions about these populations, a fact that leads us to one final reflection.",
