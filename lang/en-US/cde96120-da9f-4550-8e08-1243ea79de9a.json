Despite recent advances in understanding longevity, the descriptions of millennia-long lifespans in Sumerian texts remain incompatible with human biology.<br /><br />Moreover, the limited genetic variation among humans, as explained by A. R. Templeton, makes such extreme longevity highly improbable. Genes enabling extraordinary longevity would likely confer evolutionary advantages and become widespread—a phenomenon not observed in human populations (<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"htCleanSources(); htFillReferenceSource('2659babf-36dc-480f-a3d9-d37b8c4e1159'); return false;\">Templeton A. R., <span class=\"htdate\"></span></a>).<br /><br />Based on this evidence, the biological limits of human life are far shorter than those suggested by ancient texts.</div></div></center></p>",

It is possible that the Sumerians, recognizing the disparity between human lifespans and the monumental events they sought to describe, employed hyperbole as a narrative device. In an era of limited understanding of the universe, exaggerating lifespans could have been a way to emphasize the magnitude of achievements and the significance of their rulers.\n\nFurthermore, our concept of time has evolved significantly. Today, we understand that the universe is billions of years old, while Sumerian texts describe a much shorter timeline. Interestingly, the base-60 system we use to measure time is a legacy inherited from them",
