To do this, we started from a vision we had of these numbers through vertical Mesoamerican constructions, moved on to the diagram of the Shona kitchen in Africa, and finally arrived at the commonly used circles.\n\nThese stages show that when we understand a concept, it can be generalized according to our needs.",
