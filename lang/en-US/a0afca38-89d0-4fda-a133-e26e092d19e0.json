However, in nature, structures always begin from the smallest possible forms. For this reason, we will first examine smaller structures.\n\n#### The People’s House\n\nIn different cultures, when buildings survive for long periods—even after the people who once dominated a region have left—they are generally made of durable materials like stone. On the other hand, structures built by ordinary people often use softer materials, frequently taken directly from trees, as was common in the Americas (*Abya Yala*). These materials deteriorate more easily over time due to natural events like rain. An example can be seen in **Figure 1**:",

On the walls, we observe rectangular wooden boards placed side by side.\n\nWe can conclude that constructing these buildings required at least the following steps:\n- Placing the wood, one piece at a time, in its final position. In other words, the indigenous people added wooden pieces until they achieved the final result: the building.\n- The repetitive process of placing wood is also related to multiplication, though we usually associate this method only with addition.\n- The triangular slope of the roofs likely emerged from observing nature, as this shape allows water to flow off, preventing pooling.",
