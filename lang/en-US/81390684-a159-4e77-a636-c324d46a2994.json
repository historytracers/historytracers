We can express this comparison by stating that <b>2 ⊂ P</b> (P contains 2), <b>3 ⊂ M</b> (M contains 3), and <b>2 and 3 ⊂ P</b> (F contains 2 and 3). Alternatively, it's common to indicate a person's familial association saying the person <b>belongs (∈)</b> to a family.

Employing mathematical notation, we employ the union symbol <b>union</b> (<b>∪</b>), to merge these families into a single entity. Thus, by naming the families under study as group <b>H</b>, and uniting them,, <b>H = F ∪ (P ∪ M)</b>, we define the group <b>H</b> as <b>H = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}</b>. It's noteworthy that through this union process, duplicate numbers are eliminated, and we group by steps.</p><p class=\"desc\"><img src=\"images/Union.jpg\" class=\"imgcenter\"/>Figure 1: Union among groups.

When a person is affiliated with multiple families, each of these families collectively constitutes their own extended familial network. In mathematical terms, we can conceptualize these families as subgroups within a broader group, representing either their immediate family or their ancestral lineage. The determination of an individual's affiliation with different families is achieved through the study of group <b>intersections</b>, denoted by the symbol <b>∩</b>. To illustrate, consider the intersection <b>intersection</b> of groups <b>F</b> and <b>P</b>, yielding the result <b>F ∩ P = {2}</b>. Upon examination of these groups, we observe <b>Pedro Dias</b>, the father of <b>Fernão Dias Paes</b>, within his son's family, group <b>F</b>, while also belonging to his own parents' family, group  <b>P</b>, as anticipated.</p><p class=\"desc\"><img src=\"images/Intersection.jpg\" class=\"imgcenter\"/>Figure 2: Intersection between groups.

The first scenario occurs when we compare the same group; for instance, the union of groups <b>A = {1, 2, 3}</b> and <b>B = {1, 2, 3}</b> results in <b>C = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}</b>, which coincides with the result of the intersection, where <b>K = A ∩ B = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}</b>. In the second scenario, it's important to note that when groups have no elements, we don't represent them as <b>E = {0}</b>, as zero is a number. Instead, we denote an empty group as <b>∅</b>. With this in mind, consider the following example: the union of groups <b>G = {4, 5, 6}</b> and <b>H = {7, 8, 9}</b> results in <b>C = A ∪ B = {4, 5, 6} ∪ {7, 8, 9} = ∅</b>, which coincides with the result of the intersection, where <b>K = A ∩ B = {4, 5, 6} ∩ {7, 8, 9} = ∅</b>.</p><p>The bond between parents and children is singular, akin to the relationships within groups. Therefore, the sequence in which we denote union and intersection does not alter the outcome. To put it succinctly, we can represent <b>A ∪ B = B ∪ A</b> and <b>A ∩ B = B ∩ A</b>.</p>"
