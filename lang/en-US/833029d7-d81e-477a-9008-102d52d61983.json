Except for the 19th day, an attempt at standardization based on multiples of seven is evident.\n- The concept of a \"day\", the foundation for defining a week, was not the same as today, with some ancient peoples associating it directly with winds.\n- There was a division system with seven directions, in addition to the four cardinal points.\n- Ancient texts mention \"seven winds\", some linked to seven gods of the universe.\n- The number 50 (seven times seven plus one) appears in various Eastern calendars, most commonly in Assyria.\n- The calendar based on seven periods of 50 days, called the \"Pentecostal calendar,\" was used in Assyria, Babylon, and Palestine. However, this calendar included an additional period, known as *šapattum*, to complete the year.\n- The ancient Amorite calendar survived in Israel and can be identified in the Pentateuch (Leviticus 23:10-11 and 15-16).\n- The term *šapattum* evolved to mean either a 15-day period or the fifteenth day, while for the Hebrews, it came to signify a 7-day period or the seventh day. The problem was that using only seven days made the calendar unworkable, necessitating adjustments, as seen in the Pentateuch.\n- Based on this evidence, we conclude that the seven-day week is linked to a millennia-old tradition dating back to the Sumerians. Work interruptions occurred on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, and 49th days of the 50-day period due to the superstition that working on these days could bring misfortune. Religious reasons may also have justified these pauses.\n- As researchers note, Jews still observed the 50-day period in the 6th century BCE, according to the Gregorian calendar, with the week and the *Sabbath* interconnected. However, the reforms of <htdate0> temporarily altered this. Ezra instituted the \"Great Spring,\" and the autumn festivals permanently abandoned the Pentecostal system, which was only restored in <htdate1>.",
