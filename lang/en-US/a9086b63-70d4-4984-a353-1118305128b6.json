But, since this is an educational text, we have the freedom to go a little further and explore broader connections.\n\n#### Mapping\n\nIn Teotihuacan, to the north, and in Costa Rica, to the south, pieces with three supports have been found.

Next, we evaluated the human body into more than two groups and observed that each group can still contain internal subdivisions. This leads us to the necessity of expanding the division into groups even further to better explain what we see and think.\n\nOn the other hand, dividing into three is not necessarily bad. Through the Indigenous cultures of America (*Abya Yala*), we perceived that the number 3 was used not only in their ideas but also in everyday artifacts.\n\nObviously, there are many other cases where groups of three are present, but that will be the theme of the next text.",
