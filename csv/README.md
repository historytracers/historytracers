## CSV

This directory contains CSV files linked for readers in the `Genealogical Trees` section.

**Note**: Files should not be added here manually. Instead, follow these steps:

- Run the command `historytracers -family` to generate a new file.
- Modify the content of the generated files, and update `lang/LANGUAGE/families.json`.
- Generate the CSV file by running the command: `historytracers -gedcom`
